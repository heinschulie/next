With proper planning and an appropriate insurance policy, you can ensure that you are financially covered in the event of death, disability or severe illness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you earn an income, life insurance is essential</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people believe that if you are young, you do not require life insurance. The truth is that everyone who earns an income or has financial responsibilities should consider purchasing life insurance. The youth, like the elderly, have expenses that may need to be covered if something were to happen to them. For example, if you recently purchased an apartment or house, you may require life insurance to pay off your bond if you become disabled or die.. If someone is financially dependent on you, it’s even more important to make sure that there’s a life insurance pay-out for them if something happens to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to get your life insurance now rather than later. Insurance becomes more expensive as you get older and are more likely to become ill. By taking out life insurance in your 20s, you enjoy much lower premiums than if you took it out later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cover yourself and your loved ones</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having life insurance is an investment in the well-being of your family. It will assist your family in meeting financial obligations, allowing them to maintain a similar lifestyle <a>in the event of your death or disability.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most life insurance policies will pay out a lump sum if you die to help pay for your funeral, financially assist your dependents, and settle debts such as a home loan. Income protection benefits will pay either a lump sum or a monthly amount in the event of a disability. Severe illness benefits are typically paid in the form of a lump sum to assist you in meeting any additional costs that may arise if you become seriously ill or injured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insurance isn’t a one size fits all product</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has different circumstances and needs from the next person. Their lives, needs and the people they love and want to protect all vary. Fortunately, many well-qualified financial advisers can play an invaluable role in ensuring financial sustainability for your family by providing a needs-matched product that is unique to your needs and will perfectly protect you and your family, giving them peace of mind in the event of your death or disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial advisers must meet strict regulatory requirements and be licensed by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and product providers.&nbsp; You have the right to ask your adviser for their credentials and whether they are an independent adviser or work for a specific product provider.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n","categories":["just-for-you"],"tags":["brightrock","consumer-education","income-protection","just-for-you","life-cover","life-insurance"],"relatedPosts":["just-for-you-what-is-life-insurance-and-how-does-it-work","budgeting-for-the-future-how-life-insurance-policies-and-savings-plans-work-hand-in-hand","what-factors-affect-the-cost-of-your-life-insurance-premium","how-do-my-life-insurance-policy-and-my-savings-plan-work-hand-in-hand"],"searchString":"just : need life insurance brightrock many people believe that are young require insurance last few years have been difficult economic period both financially taxing with proper planning appropriate insurance policy can ensure covered event death disability severe illness earn income essential truth everyone who earns income financial responsibilities should consider purchasing youth like elderly expenses may something were happen them example recently purchased apartment house pay your bond become disabled die someone dependent ’s even more important make sure there’s pay out them happens &#8217;s good idea get now rather than later becomes expensive older likely ill by taking out 20s enjoy much lower premiums took later life cover yourself loved ones having investment well being family will assist family meeting obligations allowing maintain similar lifestyle death disability most policies lump sum die help funeral dependents settle debts such home loan protection benefits either monthly amount illness typically paid form any additional costs arise seriously ill injured isn’t one size fits all product different circumstances needs from next person their lives they love want protect vary fortunately well qualified advisers play invaluable role ensuring sustainability providing needs matched unique perfectly family giving peace mind must meet strict regulatory requirements licensed sector conduct authority (fsca) providers &nbsp; right ask adviser credentials whether independent work specific provider &nbsp; just consumer education income protection life cover life insurance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_improvement"],"type":["story"],"format":["text","image"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All","All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":22052,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"18/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22768,"date":"18 Aug, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Just for you: What is life insurance, and how does it work?","excerpt":"<p>Having the right life insurance cover means you are protecting your family’s future. </p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/4453_PR-Cosnumer-Education-Campaign-2022-0311.png","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"just-for-you-what-is-life-insurance-and-how-does-it-work","content":"\n<p>Do I need life insurance? This question may have crossed your mind, now or in the past. When thinking of your family, especially those who are financially dependent on you, you may experience a certain level of uneasiness and concern, especially when considering who will look after them if you can’t work because of an illness or injury, or because you’re no longer around.&nbsp; Life insurance will pay you or your beneficiaries an agreed amount if you become ill, injured, or pass away. Life insurance benefits generally include cover for death, disability, and severe illness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ensure that your loved ones are taken care of, even when you are not around</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should it happen that you are diagnosed with a critical illness or injury, become disabled, or die, you don’t want to leave your loved ones to deal with the financial burden of finding the finances to pay for rent, groceries, transport costs, school fees, or even worse – death-bed expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the right life insurance cover means you are protecting your family’s future. It means that if you can’t bring in the income that you and your family depend on, you’ll still be able to lead the same lifestyle.&nbsp; If you die, life insurance cover will pay out some money, which can then be used to pay for things like your funeral and debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With disability, severe illness and income protection benefits, your financial needs are taken care of with either a once-off payment or a monthly payment, if you meet the criteria for a claim. You can also take care of your children’s future education needs should you die or lose your monthly income because you become very ill or suffer an injury that leaves you disabled. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Earning a low salary or being young does not stop you from getting life insurance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life insurance is often thought of as something you should only get when you’re older, when you have people that financially depend on you. However, even if you are young and single, it is an important thing to have. You need to make sure that your biggest asset, your future income, is covered, and this is most important for a younger person because they have so many more years ahead of them in which they would have expected to earn this income. If that income can’t be earned, for example for 40 years, how will you support yourself? Often, people who become disabled early in life become a financial burden on older parents, who are then forced to work longer. Something else to remember is that life insurance gets more expensive the older you get. The earlier you start, the healthier you’ll be when you take out the cover, and the more affordable it will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The future is unknown, a serious health even can happen to anyone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, we cannot foresee the future. If anything, this should be even more reason for you to get life insurance cover as soon as you can. &nbsp;A car accident, for example, is just as likely to happen to a young person, as to an older person. Such an unexpected event can result in death or even permanent or temporary disability. Aside from the physical and emotional trauma caused by these events, they also mean a loss of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing you have a life insurance cover can help alleviate some of these worries and help you focus on your recovery, for example, if you’ve been in an accident. Life insurance pay-outs can also help with affording things that will help you recover quicker, such as a good wheelchair or a specialised prosthetic limb, through critical illness benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You don’t have to work it out on your own, get the assistance of a financial adviser</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good thing about life insurance, like many other areas of our lives, is that there is support available. Seeking expert advice will help you not only navigate and plan your future but will also leave you feeling relieved that your future is being taken care of. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Making the wrong decision can have serious consequences for you and your family, so it’s worthwhile to shop around for the best advice.

But, looking back, if you asked me if it was something I would do all over again, yes. It was liberating and exhilarating. You challenge yourself every day and develop as an individual and as a group of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel privileged to have been offered the opportunity by our shareholders and the industry. I am humbled to have built and seen a business flourish and come to a place where we have two million lives to protect and take care of. I appreciate what we’ve built and what we’ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are some of the biggest lessons have you learnt about the insurance industry?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I would have to say about the insurance industry is that it is a very sophisticated, developed and complicated industry. Nevertheless, the South African life insurance and financial services industries are world-class. I have had the privilege to travel to and see other markets and we stand out in terms of<br>innovation and the service we offer clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any entrepreneur who wants to follow a similar journey, you have to make sure that you have a very experienced team with you. A team that believes in the vision, purpose, what you stand for and what you want to achieve. You can’t do it on your own. You need diverse skillsets and people that are specialised in what they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second lesson is that life insurance is a very capitalintensive business that requires scale to be successful, and this is very important to appreciate at the start. In the past 11 years, BrightRock has achieved scale and has a fantastic platform that enables continuous growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What was one of/your first investment(s) – <strong>and do you still have it?</strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first investment and the one that probably served me the best is education. I spent a lot of time on that, which is one of our most valuable resources. I am very grateful for having had the opportunity to study and become an actuary. It served me exceptionally well over time and it is something that I hope people take to heart – you have got to have the right education. Education is also not always formal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Education could be working with the best for a number of years, which was key to my development – to have the opportunity to learn from the best. Learn and invest in yourself, gather skills to either play a role in an organisation’s achievements or be able to do it on your own one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What life insurance megatrends are you currently following closely?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently saw a study from one of our reinsurers in the US about a big drive around the world on customisation, meeting clients’ needs and how technology is enabling that. There is a push to create insurance offerings that try to cut out the intermediary or adviser and go to clients directly, especially on the short-term insurance side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though there is a place for that, I see the trend of consumers still looking for support from intermediaries and proper advice. They will still be looking for ease of doing business, wanting to play an active role in understanding their insurance needs and having solutions that meet those specific needs. They also want technology that enables that advice process, that makes it easier to onboard a client and interact with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I see technology playing an increasingly active role is in areas such as artificial intelligence, where client interaction will become smarter over time. Another trend is the push around big data and bringing together the understanding of a client’s holistic risk profile when it comes to buying insurance cover and then, over time, understanding how the client’s needs evolve. There are various sources to pick that up from, such as a client buying a new house and having products that can match that new need. At BrightRock, we believe we can drive that trend. To see to it that our products can match our clients’ needs on day one and as they change over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article was originally published on page 4 in the May 2022 edition of MoneyMarketing.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://b2bcentral.co.za/issues/2022/moneymarketing/May/\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original version.</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["change-moments","landing-that-job","news"],"tags":["lovechange-2","brightrock","moneymarketing","profile","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes"],"searchString":"profile: schalk malan ceo brightrock when look entrepreneurial journey coming together with partners wanting change industry challenging what prompted your move into insurance how have found thus far looking back asked something would all over again yes liberating exhilarating challenge yourself every day develop individual group people feel privileged been offered opportunity by our shareholders industry humbled built seen business flourish come place where two million lives protect take care appreciate ’ve got are some biggest lessons learnt about industry first thing say that very sophisticated developed complicated nevertheless south african life financial services industries world class had privilege travel see other markets stand out terms innovation service offer clients any entrepreneur who wants follow similar make sure experienced team believes vision purpose want achieve can’t own need diverse skillsets people specialised they second lesson capitalintensive requires scale successful this important start past 11 years achieved fantastic platform enables continuous growth one /your investment(s) – still investment probably served best education spent lot time that which most valuable resources grateful having study become actuary exceptionally well hope heart got right education also always formal could working number key development learn from best invest yourself gather skills either play role organisation’s achievements able own day megatrends currently following closely recently saw reinsurers us big drive around world customisation meeting clients’ needs technology enabling that there push create offerings try cut intermediary adviser go clients directly especially short term side though trend consumers support intermediaries proper advice will ease doing business active understanding their solutions meet those specific needs advice process makes easier onboard client interact them playing increasingly areas such artificial intelligence interaction smarter time another data bringing client’s holistic risk profile comes buying cover then time evolve various sources pick from new house products can match need brightrock believe trend article originally published page 4 may 2022 edition moneymarketing &nbsp; click here&nbsp; read original version change moments landing that job news lovechange 2 moneymarketing schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text","image"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"\"From small claim payments to permanent disability claim payments that will be paid for the rest of what would have been that member’s working life, Group Risk cover gives peace of mind, especially when that cover has been matched to members needs.\"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7606,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"16/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22737,"date":"16 Aug, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Interesting claims paid out for Group Risk cover","excerpt":"<p>For many members who have Group Risk cover through their employer, this is the only cover that they have.</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Isaac.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","content":"\n<p>Following the COVID-19 lockdowns, the 2021 looting, KwaZulu Natal (KZN) floods and now, rising inflation and interest rates – the past two years have been rather challenging. The loss of jobs, businesses, homes and loved ones has meant that people have been pressured from all sides to ensure that they can continue meeting their daily and monthly financial needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these factors have also led to higher insurance claims, both for short-term and life insurance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock, as a single long-term insurer, for example, experienced a 137% increase in the value of death claims paid out for group risk and individual life policies, compared to 2020; an increase of 110% in the number of group risk death claims; and a total cumulative pay out of more than R4.1 billion in claims to the end of May 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rising value of life insurance</strong><br>For many members who have Group Risk cover through their employer, this is the only cover that they have. Those who managed to remain employed over the last two years had the comfort of knowing that if their health took a turn for the worst, or they got injured, their family would be financially taken care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to ReMark’s 2021 Global Consumer Study, 56% of South Africans surveyed have a more positive view of life insurance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that more people understand the importance of getting life insurance, keeping life insurance and that a pay out can change a loved one’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some interesting claims paid out for Group Risk cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recurring permanent disability claim</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A member of a scheme – a 58-year-old woman – started experiencing symptoms of dementia. The scheme has both Temporary Expense Needs and Permanent Expense Needs cover. She was paid under Temporary Expense Needs, after the three-month waiting period, for five months while she was booked off sick. At the end of those five months, she failed a job fitness test permanently, as a result of her cognitive impairment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding that the nature of her job was admin-related, meant that she was never going to be able to work again. She’ll continue to receive her recurring payouts and won’t ever have to prove her disability to us again. This is because her insurer will never reassess a permanent expense needs claim, giving her, and her family relative financial peace as they deal with a difficult situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Temporary disability benefit</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another member – a 27-year-old female – ruptured her anterior and median cruciate ligaments (ACL and MCL) and tore the meniscus of her knee, while performing some of her work duties. Even though she was a part-time employee, she was covered under the scheme and her insurer was able to pay her for two months, after her one-month waiting period had passed. This payout was based on the fact<br>that her doctor had booked her off sick for three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trauma IQ payout</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of 2022, a member was riding his motorbike over a weekend, when he skidded over the road. The worst of his injuries was a badly broken arm. He needed surgery and had to remain in the hospital for some time until he could be operated on. After the surgery, the occupational therapist was happy for him to continue with rehabilitation by doing some exercises at home. His insurer was able to pay him 1% for this traumatic claim. This member’s scheme also didn’t have Additional Expense Needs cover, but because it’s automatically included in Death cover as well, he received a claim payment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These, and many more group risk claim payments have helped members and their families over the last few years. From small claim payments to permanent disability claim payments that will be paid for the rest of what would have been that member’s working life, Group Risk cover gives peace of mind, especially when that cover has been matched to members’ needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This article was originally published on page 92 in the FAnews August 2022 Edition</em> <em>and is attributed to Isaac Mudau,<em><em> BrightRock</em></em> Chief Operating Officer: Funeral and Group Risk</em>. <em><a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/publication/pdf_283_fanewsaug2022\">Click here </a>to read the original version</em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n","categories":["news"],"tags":["lovechange-2","brightrock","claims","group-risk","isaac-mudau","trauma-iq"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes"],"searchString":"interesting claims paid out group risk cover brightrock many members who have through their employer this only that they have following covid 19 lockdowns 2021 looting kwazulu natal (kzn) floods now rising inflation interest rates – past two years been rather challenging loss jobs businesses homes loved ones meant people pressured from all sides ensure can continue meeting daily monthly financial needs these factors also led higher insurance claims both short term life insurance brightrock single long term insurer example experienced 137% increase value death individual policies compared 2020; 110% number claims; total cumulative pay more than r41 billion end may 2022 those managed remain employed over last had comfort knowing health took turn worst got injured family would financially taken care according remark’s global consumer study 56% south africans surveyed positive view result pandemic means understand importance getting insurance keeping change one’s life below are some cover recurring permanent disability claim member scheme 58 year old woman started experiencing symptoms dementia temporary expense needs she under needs after three month waiting period five months while booked sick months failed job fitness test permanently her cognitive impairment understanding nature admin related never going able work again she’ll receive payouts won’t ever prove us because insurer will reassess claim giving her relative peace deal with difficult situation benefit another 27 year old female ruptured anterior median cruciate ligaments (acl mcl) tore meniscus knee performing duties even though part time employee covered one month period passed payout based fact doctor sick three months trauma iq beginning 2022 riding his motorbike weekend when he skidded road worst injuries badly broken arm needed surgery hospital time until could operated surgery occupational therapist happy him rehabilitation by doing exercises home 1% traumatic claim member’s didn’t additional cover ’s automatically included well received payment these payments helped families few years small rest what working life gives mind especially matched members’ article originally published page 92 fanews august 2022 edition  attributed  isaac mudau  chief operating officer: funeral   click here  read original version news lovechange 2 group risk isaac mudau trauma iq"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["expert"],"format":["text","image"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All","All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"\"The ideal situation is to have insurance products that are designed to empower a client and financial adviser, that can enable the co-creation of the most suitable money solutions to suit the specific needs and horizons of each individual.\"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7273,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"16/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22717,"date":"16 Aug, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Income Protection cannot take an umbrella approach","excerpt":"<p>Everyone has different circumstances that are distinct from the next person. </p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sean-2-SMALL-PR.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","content":"\n\n\n\n\n<p>As a financial adviser, you can play an invaluable role to help ensure financial sustainability for your client, through a needs-matched product that is unique to them. But how much Income Protection cover is enough, and how should it pay out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current financial analysis tools consider a client’s current income, expected annual inflation and the time that they still have left before they retire, to determine a suitable lump sum amount that represents the present value of the client’s financial need for the remainder of their working life. Capital Disability cover that pays out a single lump sum amount is still the most widely sold solution in the market for income protection needs. However, structuring this cover to meet the client’s needs at the claim stage is not as simple as it may seem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finding the balance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lump Sum products are not always suited to the client’s actual needs, especially as the client’s needs may change over time. In the case of a client becoming permanently disabled without any impact on their life expectancy, they will face the very real prospect of not having enough money for the full duration of what would have been their income-earning years, if they can’t invest this once-off payment to generate the income that they need. If the lump sum amount falls short or investment returns are unfavourable due to adverse market conditions, this could mean years or even decades without enough to live on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lump Sum cover also generally contains significant premium waste, as it is structured to keep growing at a set rate for a set period, even though clients’ income needs until they retire decrease in line with the number of pay cheques that they still expect to receive. While the lump sum suggested by the Financial Needs Analysis (FNA) tool is accurate at the time of purchase, after a period of time, it simply does not match the needs of a client</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lump Sum cover also groups various insurance needs into a single cover amount, not taking into account the fact that the underlying needs being covered are different and exist for differing terms. For example, a lump sum will be in place until a client is 65, but some of the needs it covers – such as a mortgage bond or children’s educational costs – would exist for a far shorter period. Because of this, clients end up paying more from day one for cover they don’t need for nearly as long. The cost of insurance can be significantly decreased, if each need is covered appropriately for the correct term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insurance isn’t a one size fits all product</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has different circumstances that are distinct from the next person. Their lives, needs and the people they love and want to protect all vary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why financial advisers play such a crucial role in helping to advise clients. The ideal situation is to have insurance products that are designed to empower a client and financial adviser, that can enable the co-creation of the most suitable money solutions to suit the specific needs and horizons of each individual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Getting cover right</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our industry needs to develop more sophisticated quoting systems, analysis tools and risk protection solutions that can not only calculate a lump sum, but can ensure that a client correctly allocates their Income Protection cover to the different needs that are important to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as clients allocate their monthly income to different financial needs within a manageable household budget, they should be able to cover their childcare needs, debt repayments and general household expenses through a sophisticated Income Protection solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A client should, with the help of their financial adviser, be able to control when and for how long they require cover for certain needs. By determining the appropriate periods that cover is required for, advisers can help clients remove waste, making cover affordable, while ensuring that clients’ needs are taken care of, at the right time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This article was originally published on page 93 in the FAnews August 2022 Edition</em> <em>and is attributed to Sean Hanlon, BrightRock Executive Director: Sales and Distribution</em>. <em><a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/publication/pdf_283_fanewsaug2022\">Click here </a>to read the original version</em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n","categories":["news"],"tags":["lovechange-2","brightrock","fanews","income-protection","needs-matched","sean-hanlon"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes"],"searchString":"income protection cannot take umbrella approach brightrock everyone different circumstances that are distinct from next person financial adviser can play invaluable role help ensure sustainability your client through needs matched product unique them how much cover enough should pay out current analysis tools consider client’s income expected annual inflation time they still have left before retire determine suitable lump sum amount represents present value need remainder their working life capital disability pays out single most widely sold solution market needs however structuring this meet needs claim stage simple may seem finding balance products always suited actual needs especially change over time case client becoming permanently disabled without any impact life expectancy will face very real prospect having enough money full duration what would been income earning years can’t invest once payment generate need falls short investment returns unfavourable due adverse conditions could mean years even decades live also generally contains significant premium waste structured keep growing set rate period though clients’ until retire decrease line with number cheques expect receive while suggested by (fna) tool accurate purchase after period time simply does match groups various insurance into amount taking account fact underlying being covered exist differing terms example place 65 some covers – such mortgage bond children’s educational costs far shorter period because this clients end paying more day one don’t nearly long cost significantly decreased each appropriately correct term isn’t size fits all lives people love want protect vary why advisers crucial helping advise clients ideal situation designed empower enable co creation solutions suit specific horizons individual getting right our industry develop sophisticated quoting systems risk only calculate sum correctly allocates important just allocate monthly within manageable household budget able childcare debt repayments general expenses solution should control when long require certain determining appropriate periods required remove making affordable ensuring taken care article originally published page 93 fanews august 2022 edition  attributed  sean hanlon executive director: sales distribution   click here  read original version news lovechange 2 income protection sean hanlon"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious","advisory"],"audience":["All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7606,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]},{"id":7583,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"19/07/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22608,"date":"19 Jul, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"BrightRock’s needs-matched group risk product in action – certainty when members claim.","excerpt":"<p>The last two years have been challenging for most people across the world.

We’ve seen unprecedented change, and we’ve all had to adapt to those changes and find new ways of doing things. The insurance industry has seen some of the biggest changes, with many insurers experiencing a sharp increase in claims. According to ASISA, over the 12-month period ending in April 2021, the South African life insurance industry paid a total of R29,1 billion in death claims alone. This represents an increase of 70% compared to the previous 12-month period. BrightRock too saw a substantial increase in death claims during the period. We saw a 137% increase in the value of death claims paid out for group risk and individual life policies combined in 2021 compared to 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-7o6u8\"><strong>Clients see the value of having life insurance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-4og2e\">This period has highlighted the importance of life insurance and has also given us the chance to live up to our promise to members when they need it most – when they claim. This experience has also highlighted the need for life insurance. According to ReMark’s 2021 Global Consumer Study (brought to us by SCOR), 56% of South Africans surveyed had a more positive view of life insurance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-er892\"><strong>Certainty when members claim under temporary expense needs cover</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-1b254\">Certainty is one of the pillars of the BrightRock product. This is why our product design, for all our cover options, features clear and transparent claims criteria. When we assess temporary expense needs cover claims, we first do so on a comprehensive list of clinical definitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-d0jvv\">If a member doesn’t meet the criteria for one of the clinical definitions, we can assess under sickness criteria where we can pay a claim based on the member being booked off by a medical practitioner. This has led to BrightRock being able to pay claims sooner than most of the other providers in the market. We pay claims on sickness criteria to avoid the onerous steps of having an employee, and employer, prove that an employee can’t work temporarily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-3lsj4\">Where BrightRock assesses a member’s temporary expense needs claim using occupational criteria, we can look at the client’s inability to do their own occupation – if the scheme has selected this option – at their own employer. We also clearly disclose the criteria that we use to assess members’ claims through the Job Fitness Test. This allows you, as the adviser, to show how many points a member can get, depending on the nature of their work, to qualify for a temporary expense needs claim. A member needs to score 10 or more points to qualify for a claim under this criteria on temporary expenses cover, but the condition doesn’t need to be permanent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-leq5\">The case study below demonstrates the value of the approach and the interplay between temporary and disability cover in BrightRock’s unique group risk offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-1ejtq\"><strong>Case study: Client qualifies for a temporary expense needs pay-out for dementia</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-1m1na\">In 2021, our client, a female aged 58, submitted a claim for temporary expenses. She started experiencing symptoms of dementia. The scheme has both temporary expense needs and permanent expense needs cover. We paid her temporary expense needs cover after the three-month waiting period for five months while she was booked off sick. At the end of those five months, she failed a Job Fitness Test permanently as a result of her cognitive impairment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-5lca8\">Understanding that the nature of her job was admin-related, this meant that she was never going to be able to work again.

One key aspect of budgeting is saving, and it is an element often neglected, as the cost-of-living increases and our short-term-gratification culture dominates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July 2021, the South African Reserve Bank reported that households were spending three-quarters of their take-home pay on debt. The need to budget and save have become even more critical over the past two years with many people having lost their job or income during the hard lockdown in 2020, and it’s important that we take control of our finances to ensure a better future for ourselves and those dependent on us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A financial plan for the future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When South Africans, and caregivers in particular think of their savings plan, life insurance is not likely to be the first thing they associate with saving up for what is important to them. Most people see life insurance as a grudge purchase, something that they only benefit from should something serious happen to them, or even worse, if they should die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to have both life insurance and savings plans, as they each safeguard futures in different ways. Life insurance is necessary to protect primary caregivers and their loved ones should anything happen to them and they can no longer provide for the family, while savings are critical in helping them prepare for unexpected expenses such as an emergency vehicle repair, to fund larger future needs such as their retirement, and to keep their debt to a minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the surface, life insurance doesn’t seem to have much to do with those financial goals caregivers set themselves. But it’s important to see life insurance, disability and critical illness cover, and savings as important vehicles that work hand in hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Restructuring insurance cover to free up savings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Caregivers should structure a life insurance policy so they&#8217;re managing their premiums as efficiently as possible, paying as little as they can for adequate life cover, so they have additional amounts available to supplement their savings. Getting needs-matched cover is key so that they can ensure that they’re not overpaying for cover that they don’t need, and for a period of time when they don’t need that cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example of overpaying for insurance is cover that would be paid out to look after their children if they were to pass away. They only need this cover until they’re expected to become financially independent, so they should never take out whole of life cover to cover this need, as they’ll be paying for cover after the period that the need comes to an end. Also, because the cover term is one of the factors that insurers take into account when pricing cover, they’ll pay more from the first premium for cover that’s expected to last for a longer period.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Evaluate portfolios regularly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important caregivers set up regular sessions with their financial adviser to reassess their financial portfolio and make changes if necessary. For example, perhaps they took out some life insurance a few years ago to pay off their bond or in case they became disabled or passed away. But they&#8217;ve recently come into an inheritance, however, and have since used this money to pay off their bond. Because they no longer need this cover for their bond, it is a good idea to move that cover to an area in their policy where they are possibly underinsured, or to move that amount into a savings vehicle like their retirement policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Critical illness can drain savings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical illness has an important link to savings. For example, caregivers could become disabled in a car crash and need to make multiple changes to their house, that could include the addition of ramps and modifications to their bathroom and kitchen. If they don’t have cover in place for this, the money will need to come from somewhere and unfortunately that will mean digging into savings. A small emergency fund will not be enough to pay for the significant additional expenses that could arise from a serious illness or injury, so it’s a good idea for them to ensure they’ve got critical illness cover on their life insurance policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A financial adviser can help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Fortunately, many well-qualified financial advisers can answer questions, provide clear explanations, and help interested parties understand what they’re buying when it comes to life insurance. Financial advisers must meet strict regulatory requirements and be properly licensed with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and product providers.</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","just-for-you"],"tags":["budget-speech","budgeting","clyde-parsons","consumer-education","finance"],"relatedPosts":["just-for-you-do-you-need-life-insurance","just-for-you-what-is-life-insurance-and-how-does-it-work","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes","brightrocks-2021-payout-equal-to-all-claims-paid-in-its-first-7-years-in-business"],"searchString":"budgeting future: how life insurance policies savings plans work hand brightrock when south africans caregivers particular think their plan likely first thing they associate with saving this week our minister finance enoch godongwana will delivering his budget speech which outline government&#8217;s planned expenditure over next year godongwana highlighting what areas need – such housing education healthcare government intends prioritising terms much are allocating each sector now although ’s probably given that many consumers don’t have access billions rands does principle planning monthly annual should apply all who earn income one key aspect saving element often neglected cost living increases short term gratification culture dominates july 2021 african reserve bank reported households were spending three quarters take home pay debt save become even more critical past two years people having lost job income during hard lockdown 2020 important take control finances ensure better future ourselves those dependent us financial plan them most see grudge purchase something only benefit from serious happen them worse die both plans safeguard futures different ways necessary protect primary loved ones anything them can longer provide family while helping prepare unexpected expenses emergency vehicle repair fund larger needs retirement keep debt minimum surface doesn’t seem goals set themselves insurance disability illness cover vehicles hand restructuring cover free structure policy they&#8217;re managing premiums efficiently possible paying little adequate additional amounts available supplement savings getting needs matched they’re overpaying need period time cover good example would paid out look after children pass away until expected financially independent never whole they’ll comes end also because term factors insurers into account pricing premium that’s last period evaluate portfolios regularly regular sessions adviser reassess portfolio make changes necessary example perhaps took some few ago bond case became disabled passed they&#8217;ve recently come inheritance however since used money bond bond idea move area where possibly underinsured amount like retirement policies drain link could car crash multiple house include addition ramps modifications bathroom kitchen place this somewhere unfortunately mean digging small enough significant arise injury they’ve got policy help products pretty complicated fortunately well qualified advisers answer questions clear explanations interested parties understand buying insurance must meet strict regulatory requirements properly licensed sector conduct authority (fsca) product providers content staging just budget speech clyde parsons consumer education finance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":5625,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"16/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7606,"date":"22 Apr, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Group benefits and disability claims: addressing changes","excerpt":"<p>The last two years have been challenging on the work front for all South Africans, as businesses of all sizes were severely tested by the pandemic.</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Isaac.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes","content":"\n<p>The last two years have been challenging on the work front for all South Africans, as businesses of all sizes were severely tested by the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Financial uncertainties</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many were forced to close their doors permanently, and others had to downsize in employee numbers and salaries. And the battle to survive in tough economic conditions still<br>remains real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, business was not the only element affected by COVID-19. Not only were people losing their salaries, but they were also losing loved ones. These financial uncertainties were exacerbated for many families by the threat of a breadwinner getting seriously ill, or worse, passing away. This really brought the value of group risk cover to the fore, as for some people, group risk cover is the only disability and death cover that they have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Group risk death claims</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>MetLife’s 2021 Employee Benefit Trends study found that 51% of employees believed that employers should play a greater role in the safety and protection of employees and their families. And group risk policies delivered on their promises – the Association for Savings and Investment South Africa (ASISA) revealed that the value of group risk death claims paid, increased by 139% for the period 1 April 2021 &#8211; 30 September 2021, compared to the same period in 2019, pre-COVID. Over 94 000 death claims in the group risk category were paid during the third wave of COVID-19, totalling R12,52 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These group risk payouts undoubtedly saved many families, families that would not have received any money on the death of their loved ones otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with this sharp increase in claims, came a great deal of uncertainty about what the future would bring for the group risk sector, in terms of further deaths as a result of the pandemic – and, even<br>more claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reaction to this increase, and in anticipation of further large payouts, many insurers increased their group risk premiums, which, for the members of a scheme, is seldom a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ideally suited as a solution</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers and funds are now looking out for ways to ensure that their members are still adequately covered, but at a cost that they can bear, against the backdrop of an economy under strain. And this is where efficient insurance that is designed to limit wastage, and is flexible enough to meet clients’ changing needs, can really make a difference to schemes and their members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members need cover that gives them the most cover when they’re younger – when they have more<br>pay cheques to protect – and less when they’re older. One insurer’s innovative product design, for example, can give groups up to 40% more cover for the scheme as a whole. In addition, in the event of a disability or death claim, this insurer has options available that allow the claimant to decide whether they want to take the payout as a lump-sum or as a recurring payment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this insurer launched its group risk cover in 2018, it of course could not have predicted an environment where group risk claims would more than double in a year, and put the financial future of many families in jeopardy. Cover that can match people’s needs provides a distinct advantage for both employers, and employees, and is ideally suited as a solution against a challenging economic backdrop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This article was originally published on page 87 of FAnews April 2022 edition <em>and is attributed to Isaac Mudau, BrightRock</em></em> Chief Operating Officer: Funeral and Group Risk. <em><a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/publication/pdf_271_fanewsapr2022\">Click here </a>to read the original version</em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><em>&nbsp;</em>.&nbsp;</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","disability-cover","fanews","group-risk","isaac-mudau"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"group benefits disability claims: addressing changes brightrock last two years have been challenging work front all south africans businesses sizes were severely tested by pandemic financial uncertainties many forced close their doors permanently others had downsize employee numbers salaries battle survive tough economic conditions still remains real course business only element affected covid 19 people losing salaries they also loved ones these exacerbated families threat breadwinner getting seriously ill worse passing away this really brought value risk cover fore some people death that have claims metlife’s 2021 benefit trends study found 51% employees believed employers should play greater role safety protection families policies delivered promises – association savings investment africa (asisa) revealed paid increased 139% period 1 april &#8211; 30 september 2021 compared same 2019 pre covid over 94 000 category paid during third wave covid 19 totalling r1252 billion payouts undoubtedly saved families would received any money ones otherwise however with sharp increase claims came great deal uncertainty about what future bring sector terms further deaths result pandemic even more claims reaction increase anticipation large payouts insurers premiums which members scheme seldom good thing ideally suited solution funds are now looking out ways ensure adequately covered cost can bear against backdrop economy under strain where efficient insurance designed limit wastage flexible enough meet clients’ changing needs make difference schemes members need gives them most when they’re younger pay cheques protect less older one insurer’s innovative product design example give groups 40% scheme whole addition event claim insurer options available allow claimant decide whether want take payout lump sum recurring payment launched its 2018 course could predicted environment than double year put jeopardy match people’s needs provides distinct advantage both employers employees backdrop article originally published page 87 fanews 2022 edition attributed isaac mudau chief operating officer: funeral risk click here  read original version &nbsp; &nbsp; content staging news disability cover group risk isaac mudau"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7179,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7585,"date":"16 Mar, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"BrightRock&#8217;s 2021 payout equal to all claims paid in its first 7 years in business","excerpt":"<p>In 2021, BrightRock paid as many death claims as it did in the first seven years of its existence.

The young life insurer, in which Sanlam acquired a majority stake in 2017, covers almost 2 million lives, but it paid out R1.25 billion in claims in one year. This was more than half of its total annualised premium income of R2.03 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the nine years to December 2021, BrightRock paid R3.6 billion in total claims. When excluding the 2021 claims, this amounts to less than R300 million in average claims per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the surge in claims was partly attributable to the growth in customers covered, BrightRock CEO Schalk Malan said on a &#8220;normal year&#8221;, the company would still expect to pay between R500 million and R600 million in claims. The pandemic thrust the insurer into a space it never imagined navigating so early in its lifespan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wave three, the Delta variant, was really significant, especially on our individual underwritten life business,&#8221; said Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other insurers, BrightRock found the Omicron wave less severe in terms of claims, despite bringing the highest infections with it. BrightRock is preparing for a fifth wave in the middle of the year, but this doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s that&#8217;s the last rise in Covid-19 infections it&#8217;s expecting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Can we guess and say multiple waves? I think Covid-19 will become part of life in due course, like common flu,&#8221; said Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that thanks to its &#8220;robust&#8221; reinsurance and support from its majority shareholder – Sanlam – the company has sufficient capital to navigate this challenging period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The problem is that you can&#8217;t really plan for waves… But we feel confident that we are in a positive space,&#8221; added Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like big insurers, BrightRock is reviewing its underwriting policies for the unvaccinated. The insurer wants to make sure that the new business it writes and premiums it offers clients are sustainable in the face of the unknown Covid-19 risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not because insurers are trading back. We are not saying because we paid out R1.25 billion of claims last year, we&#8217;ve got to make it up. Those costs have been accounted for. This is more about the outlook going forward and how things will be normalising,&#8221; said Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growing market share as people shop around</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the rude awakening regarding claims in 2021, BrightRock is determined to grow its market share even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021 the total cover that its individual life, group risk, and funeral cover customers had in place exceeded R380 billion, up by 8.5% from 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The insurer said it seems that the pandemic has made people think differently about life cover. They have been buying more. But they are cash-strapped and are looking for a Rolls Royce on a Polo budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan believes this is Brightrock&#8217;s time to shine because its &#8216;needs-matched&#8217; insurance &#8220;eliminates a lot of wastage&#8221;. So it&#8217;s looking to take an even bigger slice of market share from established insurers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We eliminate a lot of waste because, with other insurers, people buy some cover that&#8217;s not needed later down the line. We are sitting in a very unique situation as a business,&#8221; said Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The insurer said its market share has doubled over the last four years in terms of new business sales. The company used to sell its insurance only through independent brokers. But it has now built its own adviser force to only sell Brightrock&#8217;s products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article was originally published on Fin24 on 15 March 2022. <a href=\"https://b2bcentral.co.za/issues/2022/moneymarketing/May/\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","business-performance-results","claims","covid-19","lovechange","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"brightrock&#8217;s 2021 payout equal all claims paid its first 7 years business brightrock 2021 many death did seven existence young life insurer which sanlam acquired majority stake 2017 covers almost 2 million lives out r125 billion one year rand terms business insurer said third wave driven by delta variant hit individual clients particularly hard despite this bad experience early history wants take more market share from big insurers than half total annualised premium income r203 billion nine december r36 claims when excluding claims amounts less r300 average per although surge partly attributable growth customers covered ceo schalk malan &#8220;normal year&#8221; company would still expect pay between r500 r600 pandemic thrust into space never imagined navigating lifespan &#8220;wave three really significant especially our underwritten business &#8221; malan like other insurers found omicron wave severe bringing highest infections with preparing fifth middle year doesn&#8217;t mean &#8217;s that&#8217;s last rise covid 19 expecting &nbsp; &#8220;can guess say multiple waves think will become part due course common flu &#8221; he added that thanks &#8220;robust&#8221; reinsurance support shareholder – sufficient capital navigate challenging period &#8220; problem can&#8217;t plan waves… feel confident are positive space &#8221; reviewing underwriting policies unvaccinated make sure new writes premiums offers sustainable face unknown risks &#8220; because insurers trading back saying &#8217;ve got those costs have been accounted about outlook going forward how things normalising &#8221; growing people shop around rude awakening regarding determined grow even more cover life group risk funeral had place exceeded r380 billion 85% 2020 &nbsp; seems made differently cover they buying cash strapped looking rolls royce polo budget believes time shine &#8216;needs matched&#8217; insurance &#8220;eliminates lot wastage&#8221; bigger slice established &#8220; eliminate waste because buy some needed later down line sitting very unique situation doubled over four sales used sell only through independent brokers now built own adviser force products article originally published fin24 15 march 2022   click here  read original online version content staging news business performance results lovechange schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7239,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7583,"date":"15 Mar, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Needs-matched life insurer BrightRock announces growth in 2021, despite a challenging time for the life insurance industry","excerpt":"<p>Needs-matched life insurer, BrightRock, today provided an update on its business performance results across its individual life, group risk, and funeral businesses for the fiscal year ending 31 December 2021.</p>\n","illustration":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"needs-matched-life-insurer-brightrock-announces-growth-in-2021-despite-a-challenging-time-for-the-life-insurance-industry","content":"\n<p><em><strong>Key Performace Indicators </strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Total cover in force across its individual life, group risk and funeral businesses exceeds R380 billion, up by 8.5% from 2020, with total annualised premium income now at R2.03 billion</li><li>Total claims paid of more than R1.2 billion in 2021 alone – total claims paid to date of more than R3,6 billion (as at 31 December 2021).

BrightRock, too, saw a significant increase in claims during the course of last year with the number of death claims in its individual life business increasing by 200% in 2021,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Consumers place more emphasis on the importance of life cover</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on the previous 12 months and the effects of the COVID-19 Delta and Omicron variants</p>\n\n\n\n<p>on the industry, Malan says that, while it has been a difficult time for the industry and for BrightRock, it has also provided insurers with the opportunity to live up to their promise to their clients at a time when clients need it the most – when they claim. According to the recent <a href=\"https://cdn.remarkgroup.com/gcs/GCS2021-22-Reconnect-Life_EN.pdf\">ReMark&#8217;s 2021 Global Consumer Study</a>, 56% of South African life insurance consumers surveyed had a more positive view of life insurance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The same study found that 38% of the South Africans surveyed in the study increased the value of their life insurance cover in 2021. The study included responses from 12&nbsp;807 consumers across 22 insurance markets around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strong new business growth and record numbers of claims paid</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the difficult market conditions, BrightRock delivered industry-leading growth in 2021. According to Malan, BrightRock experienced strong growth in annualised premium income (API) in 2021, with a 11,35% year on year increase in total API. &#8220;To date, BrightRock has paid out a total of R3,6 billion (as of 31 December 2021) in claims since we sold our first policy in 2012, with R1.2 billion paid out across our business (individual life, group risk, and funeral offerings) in 2021 alone. This is the same as the total amount we paid in claims during our first seven years in business,&#8221; says Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Efficient life insurance is more important than ever before</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking about BrightRock’s individual risk product, Malan said &#8220;Although more people recognise just how important life insurance is, many of them are also earning less money than they did before the pandemic<a href=\"https://cdn.remarkgroup.com/gcs/GCS2021-22-Reconnect-Life_EN.pdf\">, with nearly one in three people experiencing a significant reduction in their income since the start of the pandemic</a>. This emphasises the importance of efficient life insurance, which allows clients to cover as much of their needs as possible for a cost-effective premium. This is, of course, something we&#8217;ve always known at BrightRock. Our needs-matched product not only precisely matches our clients’ needs, but also adds efficiency and certainty to their lives.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock has seen significant growth in the independent adviser space in terms of new business cover sold, with its market share doubling over the last four years. The widespread adoption of BrightRock’s needs-matched product design is evident in the fact that the company received one-quarter of the cover written in the large policy segment by independent financial advisers in the market in 2020. This is according to the SwissRe Individual Volume Survey for 2020 (released at the end of 2021), which also showed that BrightRock was able to provide clients with an average of 32% more cover for the same premium than the rest of the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;According to the same SwissRe survey, the fact that BrightRock can give clients more cover for the same premium has contributed to us having the highest share of new business cover written by independent financial advisers during 2020. This is a trend that continued into 2021, with the NMG Survey showing continued new business sales growth for BrightRock,&#8221; says Malan. &#8220;As a company, we are constantly looking for ways to provide even more certainty to our clients when their needs change, and the figures mentioned above, as well as our growth over the last decade, demonstrate the role we’re able to play in our clients&#8217; lives,&#8221; Malan concluded.</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","press-releases"],"tags":["brightrock","business-growth","business-performance-results","needs-matched","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["budgeting-for-the-future-how-life-insurance-policies-and-savings-plans-work-hand-in-hand","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes","brightrocks-2021-payout-equal-to-all-claims-paid-in-its-first-7-years-in-business","sas-life-insurance-sector-where-do-the-opportunities-lie-for-2022-and-beyond"],"searchString":"needs matched life insurer brightrock announces growth 2021 despite challenging time insurance industry insurer brightrock today provided update its business performance results across individual life group risk funeral businesses fiscal year ending 31 december 2021 key performace indicators total cover force risk exceeds r380 billion by 85% from 2020 with annualised premium income now r203 billion claims paid more than r12 2021 alone – date r36 ( 2021) this brightrock’s product ranked 3rd terms market share (by premium) new written independent financial advisers represents 134% adviser space once again fastest growing insurer* cover) note: figures are according nmg distribution monitor: south africa underwritten all channels_brightrock; march 2022 other include businesses 21 2022 sandton schalk malan ceo highlighted impact that past two years had sector particular requiring high degree flexibility resilience seen some biggest changes result covid 19 pandemic many insurers reporting significant increase claims african r291 death during 12 months april 70% over previous 12 month period too saw course last number increasing 200% 2021 he said consumers place emphasis importance reflecting effects delta omicron variants industry malan says that while been difficult also opportunity live their promise clients when need most they claim recent remark&#8217;s global consumer study 56% surveyed positive view pandemic same found 38% africans increased value included responses 12&nbsp;807 22 markets around world strong record numbers conditions delivered industry leading experienced (api) 1135% api &#8220; date out 2021) since sold our first policy 2012 (individual offerings) alone amount seven business &#8221; malan efficient important ever before speaking about product said &#8220;although people recognise just how them earning less money did pandemic nearly one three experiencing reduction start emphasises insurance which allows much needs possible cost effective premium course something &#8217;ve always known brightrock only precisely matches clients’ needs adds efficiency certainty lives &#8221; sold doubling four years widespread adoption design evident fact company received one quarter large segment 2020 swissre volume survey 2020 (released end 2021) showed able provide average 32% rest market &#8220;according survey can give contributed us having highest trend continued into showing sales brightrock &#8221; &#8220; company constantly looking ways even change mentioned above well decade demonstrate role ’re play clients&#8217; lives &#8221; concluded content staging press releases business growth business performance results schalk malan"}]
