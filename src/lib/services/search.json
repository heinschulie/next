With proper planning and an appropriate insurance policy, you can ensure that you are financially covered in the event of death, disability or severe illness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you earn an income, life insurance is essential</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people believe that if you are young, you do not require life insurance. The truth is that everyone who earns an income or has financial responsibilities should consider purchasing life insurance. The youth, like the elderly, have expenses that may need to be covered if something were to happen to them. For example, if you recently purchased an apartment or house, you may require life insurance to pay off your bond if you become disabled or die.. If someone is financially dependent on you, it’s even more important to make sure that there’s a life insurance pay-out for them if something happens to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to get your life insurance now rather than later. Insurance becomes more expensive as you get older and are more likely to become ill. By taking out life insurance in your 20s, you enjoy much lower premiums than if you took it out later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cover yourself and your loved ones</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having life insurance is an investment in the well-being of your family. It will assist your family in meeting financial obligations, allowing them to maintain a similar lifestyle <a>in the event of your death or disability.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most life insurance policies will pay out a lump sum if you die to help pay for your funeral, financially assist your dependents, and settle debts such as a home loan. Income protection benefits will pay either a lump sum or a monthly amount in the event of a disability. Severe illness benefits are typically paid in the form of a lump sum to assist you in meeting any additional costs that may arise if you become seriously ill or injured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insurance isn’t a one size fits all product</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has different circumstances and needs from the next person. Their lives, needs and the people they love and want to protect all vary. Fortunately, many well-qualified financial advisers can play an invaluable role in ensuring financial sustainability for your family by providing a needs-matched product that is unique to your needs and will perfectly protect you and your family, giving them peace of mind in the event of your death or disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial advisers must meet strict regulatory requirements and be licensed by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and product providers.&nbsp; You have the right to ask your adviser for their credentials and whether they are an independent adviser or work for a specific product provider.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n","categories":["just-for-you"],"tags":["brightrock","consumer-education","income-protection","just-for-you","life-cover","life-insurance"],"relatedPosts":["just-for-you-what-is-life-insurance-and-how-does-it-work","budgeting-for-the-future-how-life-insurance-policies-and-savings-plans-work-hand-in-hand","what-factors-affect-the-cost-of-your-life-insurance-premium","how-do-my-life-insurance-policy-and-my-savings-plan-work-hand-in-hand"],"searchString":"just : need life insurance brightrock many people believe that are young require insurance last few years have been difficult economic period both financially taxing with proper planning appropriate insurance policy can ensure covered event death disability severe illness earn income essential truth everyone who earns income financial responsibilities should consider purchasing youth like elderly expenses may something were happen them example recently purchased apartment house pay your bond become disabled die someone dependent ’s even more important make sure there’s pay out them happens &#8217;s good idea get now rather than later becomes expensive older likely ill by taking out 20s enjoy much lower premiums took later life cover yourself loved ones having investment well being family will assist family meeting obligations allowing maintain similar lifestyle death disability most policies lump sum die help funeral dependents settle debts such home loan protection benefits either monthly amount illness typically paid form any additional costs arise seriously ill injured isn’t one size fits all product different circumstances needs from next person their lives they love want protect vary fortunately well qualified advisers play invaluable role ensuring sustainability providing needs matched unique perfectly family giving peace mind must meet strict regulatory requirements licensed sector conduct authority (fsca) providers &nbsp; right ask adviser credentials whether independent work specific provider &nbsp; just consumer education income protection life cover life insurance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_improvement"],"type":["story"],"format":["text","image"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All","All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":22052,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"18/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22768,"date":"18 Aug, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Just for you: What is life insurance, and how does it work?","excerpt":"<p>Having the right life insurance cover means you are protecting your family’s future. </p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/4453_PR-Cosnumer-Education-Campaign-2022-0311.png","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"just-for-you-what-is-life-insurance-and-how-does-it-work","content":"\n<p>Do I need life insurance? This question may have crossed your mind, now or in the past. When thinking of your family, especially those who are financially dependent on you, you may experience a certain level of uneasiness and concern, especially when considering who will look after them if you can’t work because of an illness or injury, or because you’re no longer around.&nbsp; Life insurance will pay you or your beneficiaries an agreed amount if you become ill, injured, or pass away. Life insurance benefits generally include cover for death, disability, and severe illness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ensure that your loved ones are taken care of, even when you are not around</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should it happen that you are diagnosed with a critical illness or injury, become disabled, or die, you don’t want to leave your loved ones to deal with the financial burden of finding the finances to pay for rent, groceries, transport costs, school fees, or even worse – death-bed expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the right life insurance cover means you are protecting your family’s future. It means that if you can’t bring in the income that you and your family depend on, you’ll still be able to lead the same lifestyle.&nbsp; If you die, life insurance cover will pay out some money, which can then be used to pay for things like your funeral and debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With disability, severe illness and income protection benefits, your financial needs are taken care of with either a once-off payment or a monthly payment, if you meet the criteria for a claim. You can also take care of your children’s future education needs should you die or lose your monthly income because you become very ill or suffer an injury that leaves you disabled. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Earning a low salary or being young does not stop you from getting life insurance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life insurance is often thought of as something you should only get when you’re older, when you have people that financially depend on you. However, even if you are young and single, it is an important thing to have. You need to make sure that your biggest asset, your future income, is covered, and this is most important for a younger person because they have so many more years ahead of them in which they would have expected to earn this income. If that income can’t be earned, for example for 40 years, how will you support yourself? Often, people who become disabled early in life become a financial burden on older parents, who are then forced to work longer. Something else to remember is that life insurance gets more expensive the older you get. The earlier you start, the healthier you’ll be when you take out the cover, and the more affordable it will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The future is unknown, a serious health even can happen to anyone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, we cannot foresee the future. If anything, this should be even more reason for you to get life insurance cover as soon as you can. &nbsp;A car accident, for example, is just as likely to happen to a young person, as to an older person. Such an unexpected event can result in death or even permanent or temporary disability. Aside from the physical and emotional trauma caused by these events, they also mean a loss of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing you have a life insurance cover can help alleviate some of these worries and help you focus on your recovery, for example, if you’ve been in an accident. Life insurance pay-outs can also help with affording things that will help you recover quicker, such as a good wheelchair or a specialised prosthetic limb, through critical illness benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You don’t have to work it out on your own, get the assistance of a financial adviser</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good thing about life insurance, like many other areas of our lives, is that there is support available. Seeking expert advice will help you not only navigate and plan your future but will also leave you feeling relieved that your future is being taken care of. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Making the wrong decision can have serious consequences for you and your family, so it’s worthwhile to shop around for the best advice.

But, looking back, if you asked me if it was something I would do all over again, yes. It was liberating and exhilarating. You challenge yourself every day and develop as an individual and as a group of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel privileged to have been offered the opportunity by our shareholders and the industry. I am humbled to have built and seen a business flourish and come to a place where we have two million lives to protect and take care of. I appreciate what we’ve built and what we’ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are some of the biggest lessons have you learnt about the insurance industry?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I would have to say about the insurance industry is that it is a very sophisticated, developed and complicated industry. Nevertheless, the South African life insurance and financial services industries are world-class. I have had the privilege to travel to and see other markets and we stand out in terms of<br>innovation and the service we offer clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any entrepreneur who wants to follow a similar journey, you have to make sure that you have a very experienced team with you. A team that believes in the vision, purpose, what you stand for and what you want to achieve. You can’t do it on your own. You need diverse skillsets and people that are specialised in what they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second lesson is that life insurance is a very capitalintensive business that requires scale to be successful, and this is very important to appreciate at the start. In the past 11 years, BrightRock has achieved scale and has a fantastic platform that enables continuous growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What was one of/your first investment(s) – <strong>and do you still have it?</strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first investment and the one that probably served me the best is education. I spent a lot of time on that, which is one of our most valuable resources. I am very grateful for having had the opportunity to study and become an actuary. It served me exceptionally well over time and it is something that I hope people take to heart – you have got to have the right education. Education is also not always formal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Education could be working with the best for a number of years, which was key to my development – to have the opportunity to learn from the best. Learn and invest in yourself, gather skills to either play a role in an organisation’s achievements or be able to do it on your own one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What life insurance megatrends are you currently following closely?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently saw a study from one of our reinsurers in the US about a big drive around the world on customisation, meeting clients’ needs and how technology is enabling that. There is a push to create insurance offerings that try to cut out the intermediary or adviser and go to clients directly, especially on the short-term insurance side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though there is a place for that, I see the trend of consumers still looking for support from intermediaries and proper advice. They will still be looking for ease of doing business, wanting to play an active role in understanding their insurance needs and having solutions that meet those specific needs. They also want technology that enables that advice process, that makes it easier to onboard a client and interact with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I see technology playing an increasingly active role is in areas such as artificial intelligence, where client interaction will become smarter over time. Another trend is the push around big data and bringing together the understanding of a client’s holistic risk profile when it comes to buying insurance cover and then, over time, understanding how the client’s needs evolve. There are various sources to pick that up from, such as a client buying a new house and having products that can match that new need. At BrightRock, we believe we can drive that trend. To see to it that our products can match our clients’ needs on day one and as they change over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article was originally published on page 4 in the May 2022 edition of MoneyMarketing.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://b2bcentral.co.za/issues/2022/moneymarketing/May/\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original version.</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["change-moments","landing-that-job","news"],"tags":["lovechange-2","brightrock","moneymarketing","profile","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes"],"searchString":"profile: schalk malan ceo brightrock when look entrepreneurial journey coming together with partners wanting change industry challenging what prompted your move into insurance how have found thus far looking back asked something would all over again yes liberating exhilarating challenge yourself every day develop individual group people feel privileged been offered opportunity by our shareholders industry humbled built seen business flourish come place where two million lives protect take care appreciate ’ve got are some biggest lessons learnt about industry first thing say that very sophisticated developed complicated nevertheless south african life financial services industries world class had privilege travel see other markets stand out terms innovation service offer clients any entrepreneur who wants follow similar make sure experienced team believes vision purpose want achieve can’t own need diverse skillsets people specialised they second lesson capitalintensive requires scale successful this important start past 11 years achieved fantastic platform enables continuous growth one /your investment(s) – still investment probably served best education spent lot time that which most valuable resources grateful having study become actuary exceptionally well hope heart got right education also always formal could working number key development learn from best invest yourself gather skills either play role organisation’s achievements able own day megatrends currently following closely recently saw reinsurers us big drive around world customisation meeting clients’ needs technology enabling that there push create offerings try cut intermediary adviser go clients directly especially short term side though trend consumers support intermediaries proper advice will ease doing business active understanding their solutions meet those specific needs advice process makes easier onboard client interact them playing increasingly areas such artificial intelligence interaction smarter time another data bringing client’s holistic risk profile comes buying cover then time evolve various sources pick from new house products can match need brightrock believe trend article originally published page 4 may 2022 edition moneymarketing &nbsp; click here&nbsp; read original version change moments landing that job news lovechange 2 moneymarketing schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text","image"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"\"From small claim payments to permanent disability claim payments that will be paid for the rest of what would have been that member’s working life, Group Risk cover gives peace of mind, especially when that cover has been matched to members needs.\"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7606,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"16/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22737,"date":"16 Aug, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Interesting claims paid out for Group Risk cover","excerpt":"<p>For many members who have Group Risk cover through their employer, this is the only cover that they have.</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Isaac.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","content":"\n<p>Following the COVID-19 lockdowns, the 2021 looting, KwaZulu Natal (KZN) floods and now, rising inflation and interest rates – the past two years have been rather challenging. The loss of jobs, businesses, homes and loved ones has meant that people have been pressured from all sides to ensure that they can continue meeting their daily and monthly financial needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these factors have also led to higher insurance claims, both for short-term and life insurance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock, as a single long-term insurer, for example, experienced a 137% increase in the value of death claims paid out for group risk and individual life policies, compared to 2020; an increase of 110% in the number of group risk death claims; and a total cumulative pay out of more than R4.1 billion in claims to the end of May 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rising value of life insurance</strong><br>For many members who have Group Risk cover through their employer, this is the only cover that they have. Those who managed to remain employed over the last two years had the comfort of knowing that if their health took a turn for the worst, or they got injured, their family would be financially taken care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to ReMark’s 2021 Global Consumer Study, 56% of South Africans surveyed have a more positive view of life insurance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that more people understand the importance of getting life insurance, keeping life insurance and that a pay out can change a loved one’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some interesting claims paid out for Group Risk cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recurring permanent disability claim</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A member of a scheme – a 58-year-old woman – started experiencing symptoms of dementia. The scheme has both Temporary Expense Needs and Permanent Expense Needs cover. She was paid under Temporary Expense Needs, after the three-month waiting period, for five months while she was booked off sick. At the end of those five months, she failed a job fitness test permanently, as a result of her cognitive impairment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding that the nature of her job was admin-related, meant that she was never going to be able to work again. She’ll continue to receive her recurring payouts and won’t ever have to prove her disability to us again. This is because her insurer will never reassess a permanent expense needs claim, giving her, and her family relative financial peace as they deal with a difficult situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Temporary disability benefit</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another member – a 27-year-old female – ruptured her anterior and median cruciate ligaments (ACL and MCL) and tore the meniscus of her knee, while performing some of her work duties. Even though she was a part-time employee, she was covered under the scheme and her insurer was able to pay her for two months, after her one-month waiting period had passed. This payout was based on the fact<br>that her doctor had booked her off sick for three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trauma IQ payout</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of 2022, a member was riding his motorbike over a weekend, when he skidded over the road. The worst of his injuries was a badly broken arm. He needed surgery and had to remain in the hospital for some time until he could be operated on. After the surgery, the occupational therapist was happy for him to continue with rehabilitation by doing some exercises at home. His insurer was able to pay him 1% for this traumatic claim. This member’s scheme also didn’t have Additional Expense Needs cover, but because it’s automatically included in Death cover as well, he received a claim payment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These, and many more group risk claim payments have helped members and their families over the last few years. From small claim payments to permanent disability claim payments that will be paid for the rest of what would have been that member’s working life, Group Risk cover gives peace of mind, especially when that cover has been matched to members’ needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This article was originally published on page 92 in the FAnews August 2022 Edition</em> <em>and is attributed to Isaac Mudau,<em><em> BrightRock</em></em> Chief Operating Officer: Funeral and Group Risk</em>. <em><a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/publication/pdf_283_fanewsaug2022\">Click here </a>to read the original version</em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n","categories":["news"],"tags":["lovechange-2","brightrock","claims","group-risk","isaac-mudau","trauma-iq"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes"],"searchString":"interesting claims paid out group risk cover brightrock many members who have through their employer this only that they have following covid 19 lockdowns 2021 looting kwazulu natal (kzn) floods now rising inflation interest rates – past two years been rather challenging loss jobs businesses homes loved ones meant people pressured from all sides ensure can continue meeting daily monthly financial needs these factors also led higher insurance claims both short term life insurance brightrock single long term insurer example experienced 137% increase value death individual policies compared 2020; 110% number claims; total cumulative pay more than r41 billion end may 2022 those managed remain employed over last had comfort knowing health took turn worst got injured family would financially taken care according remark’s global consumer study 56% south africans surveyed positive view result pandemic means understand importance getting insurance keeping change one’s life below are some cover recurring permanent disability claim member scheme 58 year old woman started experiencing symptoms dementia temporary expense needs she under needs after three month waiting period five months while booked sick months failed job fitness test permanently her cognitive impairment understanding nature admin related never going able work again she’ll receive payouts won’t ever prove us because insurer will reassess claim giving her relative peace deal with difficult situation benefit another 27 year old female ruptured anterior median cruciate ligaments (acl mcl) tore meniscus knee performing duties even though part time employee covered one month period passed payout based fact doctor sick three months trauma iq beginning 2022 riding his motorbike weekend when he skidded road worst injuries badly broken arm needed surgery hospital time until could operated surgery occupational therapist happy him rehabilitation by doing exercises home 1% traumatic claim member’s didn’t additional cover ’s automatically included well received payment these payments helped families few years small rest what working life gives mind especially matched members’ article originally published page 92 fanews august 2022 edition  attributed  isaac mudau  chief operating officer: funeral   click here  read original version news lovechange 2 group risk isaac mudau trauma iq"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["expert"],"format":["text","image"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All","All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"\"The ideal situation is to have insurance products that are designed to empower a client and financial adviser, that can enable the co-creation of the most suitable money solutions to suit the specific needs and horizons of each individual.\"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7273,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"16/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22717,"date":"16 Aug, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Income Protection cannot take an umbrella approach","excerpt":"<p>Everyone has different circumstances that are distinct from the next person. </p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sean-2-SMALL-PR.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","content":"\n\n\n\n\n<p>As a financial adviser, you can play an invaluable role to help ensure financial sustainability for your client, through a needs-matched product that is unique to them. But how much Income Protection cover is enough, and how should it pay out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current financial analysis tools consider a client’s current income, expected annual inflation and the time that they still have left before they retire, to determine a suitable lump sum amount that represents the present value of the client’s financial need for the remainder of their working life. Capital Disability cover that pays out a single lump sum amount is still the most widely sold solution in the market for income protection needs. However, structuring this cover to meet the client’s needs at the claim stage is not as simple as it may seem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finding the balance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lump Sum products are not always suited to the client’s actual needs, especially as the client’s needs may change over time. In the case of a client becoming permanently disabled without any impact on their life expectancy, they will face the very real prospect of not having enough money for the full duration of what would have been their income-earning years, if they can’t invest this once-off payment to generate the income that they need. If the lump sum amount falls short or investment returns are unfavourable due to adverse market conditions, this could mean years or even decades without enough to live on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lump Sum cover also generally contains significant premium waste, as it is structured to keep growing at a set rate for a set period, even though clients’ income needs until they retire decrease in line with the number of pay cheques that they still expect to receive. While the lump sum suggested by the Financial Needs Analysis (FNA) tool is accurate at the time of purchase, after a period of time, it simply does not match the needs of a client</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lump Sum cover also groups various insurance needs into a single cover amount, not taking into account the fact that the underlying needs being covered are different and exist for differing terms. For example, a lump sum will be in place until a client is 65, but some of the needs it covers – such as a mortgage bond or children’s educational costs – would exist for a far shorter period. Because of this, clients end up paying more from day one for cover they don’t need for nearly as long. The cost of insurance can be significantly decreased, if each need is covered appropriately for the correct term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insurance isn’t a one size fits all product</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has different circumstances that are distinct from the next person. Their lives, needs and the people they love and want to protect all vary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why financial advisers play such a crucial role in helping to advise clients. The ideal situation is to have insurance products that are designed to empower a client and financial adviser, that can enable the co-creation of the most suitable money solutions to suit the specific needs and horizons of each individual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Getting cover right</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our industry needs to develop more sophisticated quoting systems, analysis tools and risk protection solutions that can not only calculate a lump sum, but can ensure that a client correctly allocates their Income Protection cover to the different needs that are important to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as clients allocate their monthly income to different financial needs within a manageable household budget, they should be able to cover their childcare needs, debt repayments and general household expenses through a sophisticated Income Protection solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A client should, with the help of their financial adviser, be able to control when and for how long they require cover for certain needs. By determining the appropriate periods that cover is required for, advisers can help clients remove waste, making cover affordable, while ensuring that clients’ needs are taken care of, at the right time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This article was originally published on page 93 in the FAnews August 2022 Edition</em> <em>and is attributed to Sean Hanlon, BrightRock Executive Director: Sales and Distribution</em>. <em><a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/publication/pdf_283_fanewsaug2022\">Click here </a>to read the original version</em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n","categories":["news"],"tags":["lovechange-2","brightrock","fanews","income-protection","needs-matched","sean-hanlon"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes"],"searchString":"income protection cannot take umbrella approach brightrock everyone different circumstances that are distinct from next person financial adviser can play invaluable role help ensure sustainability your client through needs matched product unique them how much cover enough should pay out current analysis tools consider client’s income expected annual inflation time they still have left before retire determine suitable lump sum amount represents present value need remainder their working life capital disability pays out single most widely sold solution market needs however structuring this meet needs claim stage simple may seem finding balance products always suited actual needs especially change over time case client becoming permanently disabled without any impact life expectancy will face very real prospect having enough money full duration what would been income earning years can’t invest once payment generate need falls short investment returns unfavourable due adverse conditions could mean years even decades live also generally contains significant premium waste structured keep growing set rate period though clients’ until retire decrease line with number cheques expect receive while suggested by (fna) tool accurate purchase after period time simply does match groups various insurance into amount taking account fact underlying being covered exist differing terms example place 65 some covers – such mortgage bond children’s educational costs far shorter period because this clients end paying more day one don’t nearly long cost significantly decreased each appropriately correct term isn’t size fits all lives people love want protect vary why advisers crucial helping advise clients ideal situation designed empower enable co creation solutions suit specific horizons individual getting right our industry develop sophisticated quoting systems risk only calculate sum correctly allocates important just allocate monthly within manageable household budget able childcare debt repayments general expenses solution should control when long require certain determining appropriate periods required remove making affordable ensuring taken care article originally published page 93 fanews august 2022 edition  attributed  sean hanlon executive director: sales distribution   click here  read original version news lovechange 2 income protection sean hanlon"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious","advisory"],"audience":["All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7606,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]},{"id":7583,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"19/07/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22608,"date":"19 Jul, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"BrightRock’s needs-matched group risk product in action – certainty when members claim.","excerpt":"<p>The last two years have been challenging for most people across the world.

We’ve seen unprecedented change, and we’ve all had to adapt to those changes and find new ways of doing things. The insurance industry has seen some of the biggest changes, with many insurers experiencing a sharp increase in claims. According to ASISA, over the 12-month period ending in April 2021, the South African life insurance industry paid a total of R29,1 billion in death claims alone. This represents an increase of 70% compared to the previous 12-month period. BrightRock too saw a substantial increase in death claims during the period. We saw a 137% increase in the value of death claims paid out for group risk and individual life policies combined in 2021 compared to 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-7o6u8\"><strong>Clients see the value of having life insurance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-4og2e\">This period has highlighted the importance of life insurance and has also given us the chance to live up to our promise to members when they need it most – when they claim. This experience has also highlighted the need for life insurance. According to ReMark’s 2021 Global Consumer Study (brought to us by SCOR), 56% of South Africans surveyed had a more positive view of life insurance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-er892\"><strong>Certainty when members claim under temporary expense needs cover</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-1b254\">Certainty is one of the pillars of the BrightRock product. This is why our product design, for all our cover options, features clear and transparent claims criteria. When we assess temporary expense needs cover claims, we first do so on a comprehensive list of clinical definitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-d0jvv\">If a member doesn’t meet the criteria for one of the clinical definitions, we can assess under sickness criteria where we can pay a claim based on the member being booked off by a medical practitioner. This has led to BrightRock being able to pay claims sooner than most of the other providers in the market. We pay claims on sickness criteria to avoid the onerous steps of having an employee, and employer, prove that an employee can’t work temporarily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-3lsj4\">Where BrightRock assesses a member’s temporary expense needs claim using occupational criteria, we can look at the client’s inability to do their own occupation – if the scheme has selected this option – at their own employer. We also clearly disclose the criteria that we use to assess members’ claims through the Job Fitness Test. This allows you, as the adviser, to show how many points a member can get, depending on the nature of their work, to qualify for a temporary expense needs claim. A member needs to score 10 or more points to qualify for a claim under this criteria on temporary expenses cover, but the condition doesn’t need to be permanent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-leq5\">The case study below demonstrates the value of the approach and the interplay between temporary and disability cover in BrightRock’s unique group risk offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-1ejtq\"><strong>Case study: Client qualifies for a temporary expense needs pay-out for dementia</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-1m1na\">In 2021, our client, a female aged 58, submitted a claim for temporary expenses. She started experiencing symptoms of dementia. The scheme has both temporary expense needs and permanent expense needs cover. We paid her temporary expense needs cover after the three-month waiting period for five months while she was booked off sick. At the end of those five months, she failed a Job Fitness Test permanently as a result of her cognitive impairment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-5lca8\">Understanding that the nature of her job was admin-related, this meant that she was never going to be able to work again.

One key aspect of budgeting is saving, and it is an element often neglected, as the cost-of-living increases and our short-term-gratification culture dominates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July 2021, the South African Reserve Bank reported that households were spending three-quarters of their take-home pay on debt. The need to budget and save have become even more critical over the past two years with many people having lost their job or income during the hard lockdown in 2020, and it’s important that we take control of our finances to ensure a better future for ourselves and those dependent on us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A financial plan for the future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When South Africans, and caregivers in particular think of their savings plan, life insurance is not likely to be the first thing they associate with saving up for what is important to them. Most people see life insurance as a grudge purchase, something that they only benefit from should something serious happen to them, or even worse, if they should die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to have both life insurance and savings plans, as they each safeguard futures in different ways. Life insurance is necessary to protect primary caregivers and their loved ones should anything happen to them and they can no longer provide for the family, while savings are critical in helping them prepare for unexpected expenses such as an emergency vehicle repair, to fund larger future needs such as their retirement, and to keep their debt to a minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the surface, life insurance doesn’t seem to have much to do with those financial goals caregivers set themselves. But it’s important to see life insurance, disability and critical illness cover, and savings as important vehicles that work hand in hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Restructuring insurance cover to free up savings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Caregivers should structure a life insurance policy so they&#8217;re managing their premiums as efficiently as possible, paying as little as they can for adequate life cover, so they have additional amounts available to supplement their savings. Getting needs-matched cover is key so that they can ensure that they’re not overpaying for cover that they don’t need, and for a period of time when they don’t need that cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example of overpaying for insurance is cover that would be paid out to look after their children if they were to pass away. They only need this cover until they’re expected to become financially independent, so they should never take out whole of life cover to cover this need, as they’ll be paying for cover after the period that the need comes to an end. Also, because the cover term is one of the factors that insurers take into account when pricing cover, they’ll pay more from the first premium for cover that’s expected to last for a longer period.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Evaluate portfolios regularly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important caregivers set up regular sessions with their financial adviser to reassess their financial portfolio and make changes if necessary. For example, perhaps they took out some life insurance a few years ago to pay off their bond or in case they became disabled or passed away. But they&#8217;ve recently come into an inheritance, however, and have since used this money to pay off their bond. Because they no longer need this cover for their bond, it is a good idea to move that cover to an area in their policy where they are possibly underinsured, or to move that amount into a savings vehicle like their retirement policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Critical illness can drain savings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical illness has an important link to savings. For example, caregivers could become disabled in a car crash and need to make multiple changes to their house, that could include the addition of ramps and modifications to their bathroom and kitchen. If they don’t have cover in place for this, the money will need to come from somewhere and unfortunately that will mean digging into savings. A small emergency fund will not be enough to pay for the significant additional expenses that could arise from a serious illness or injury, so it’s a good idea for them to ensure they’ve got critical illness cover on their life insurance policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A financial adviser can help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Fortunately, many well-qualified financial advisers can answer questions, provide clear explanations, and help interested parties understand what they’re buying when it comes to life insurance. Financial advisers must meet strict regulatory requirements and be properly licensed with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and product providers.</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","just-for-you"],"tags":["budget-speech","budgeting","clyde-parsons","consumer-education","finance"],"relatedPosts":["just-for-you-do-you-need-life-insurance","just-for-you-what-is-life-insurance-and-how-does-it-work","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes","brightrocks-2021-payout-equal-to-all-claims-paid-in-its-first-7-years-in-business"],"searchString":"budgeting future: how life insurance policies savings plans work hand brightrock when south africans caregivers particular think their plan likely first thing they associate with saving this week our minister finance enoch godongwana will delivering his budget speech which outline government&#8217;s planned expenditure over next year godongwana highlighting what areas need – such housing education healthcare government intends prioritising terms much are allocating each sector now although ’s probably given that many consumers don’t have access billions rands does principle planning monthly annual should apply all who earn income one key aspect saving element often neglected cost living increases short term gratification culture dominates july 2021 african reserve bank reported households were spending three quarters take home pay debt save become even more critical past two years people having lost job income during hard lockdown 2020 important take control finances ensure better future ourselves those dependent us financial plan them most see grudge purchase something only benefit from serious happen them worse die both plans safeguard futures different ways necessary protect primary loved ones anything them can longer provide family while helping prepare unexpected expenses emergency vehicle repair fund larger needs retirement keep debt minimum surface doesn’t seem goals set themselves insurance disability illness cover vehicles hand restructuring cover free structure policy they&#8217;re managing premiums efficiently possible paying little adequate additional amounts available supplement savings getting needs matched they’re overpaying need period time cover good example would paid out look after children pass away until expected financially independent never whole they’ll comes end also because term factors insurers into account pricing premium that’s last period evaluate portfolios regularly regular sessions adviser reassess portfolio make changes necessary example perhaps took some few ago bond case became disabled passed they&#8217;ve recently come inheritance however since used money bond bond idea move area where possibly underinsured amount like retirement policies drain link could car crash multiple house include addition ramps modifications bathroom kitchen place this somewhere unfortunately mean digging small enough significant arise injury they’ve got policy help products pretty complicated fortunately well qualified advisers answer questions clear explanations interested parties understand buying insurance must meet strict regulatory requirements properly licensed sector conduct authority (fsca) product providers content staging just budget speech clyde parsons consumer education finance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":5625,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"16/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7606,"date":"22 Apr, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Group benefits and disability claims: addressing changes","excerpt":"<p>The last two years have been challenging on the work front for all South Africans, as businesses of all sizes were severely tested by the pandemic.</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Isaac.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes","content":"\n<p>The last two years have been challenging on the work front for all South Africans, as businesses of all sizes were severely tested by the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Financial uncertainties</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many were forced to close their doors permanently, and others had to downsize in employee numbers and salaries. And the battle to survive in tough economic conditions still<br>remains real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, business was not the only element affected by COVID-19. Not only were people losing their salaries, but they were also losing loved ones. These financial uncertainties were exacerbated for many families by the threat of a breadwinner getting seriously ill, or worse, passing away. This really brought the value of group risk cover to the fore, as for some people, group risk cover is the only disability and death cover that they have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Group risk death claims</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>MetLife’s 2021 Employee Benefit Trends study found that 51% of employees believed that employers should play a greater role in the safety and protection of employees and their families. And group risk policies delivered on their promises – the Association for Savings and Investment South Africa (ASISA) revealed that the value of group risk death claims paid, increased by 139% for the period 1 April 2021 &#8211; 30 September 2021, compared to the same period in 2019, pre-COVID. Over 94 000 death claims in the group risk category were paid during the third wave of COVID-19, totalling R12,52 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These group risk payouts undoubtedly saved many families, families that would not have received any money on the death of their loved ones otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with this sharp increase in claims, came a great deal of uncertainty about what the future would bring for the group risk sector, in terms of further deaths as a result of the pandemic – and, even<br>more claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reaction to this increase, and in anticipation of further large payouts, many insurers increased their group risk premiums, which, for the members of a scheme, is seldom a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ideally suited as a solution</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers and funds are now looking out for ways to ensure that their members are still adequately covered, but at a cost that they can bear, against the backdrop of an economy under strain. And this is where efficient insurance that is designed to limit wastage, and is flexible enough to meet clients’ changing needs, can really make a difference to schemes and their members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members need cover that gives them the most cover when they’re younger – when they have more<br>pay cheques to protect – and less when they’re older. One insurer’s innovative product design, for example, can give groups up to 40% more cover for the scheme as a whole. In addition, in the event of a disability or death claim, this insurer has options available that allow the claimant to decide whether they want to take the payout as a lump-sum or as a recurring payment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this insurer launched its group risk cover in 2018, it of course could not have predicted an environment where group risk claims would more than double in a year, and put the financial future of many families in jeopardy. Cover that can match people’s needs provides a distinct advantage for both employers, and employees, and is ideally suited as a solution against a challenging economic backdrop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This article was originally published on page 87 of FAnews April 2022 edition <em>and is attributed to Isaac Mudau, BrightRock</em></em> Chief Operating Officer: Funeral and Group Risk. <em><a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/publication/pdf_271_fanewsapr2022\">Click here </a>to read the original version</em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><em>&nbsp;</em>.&nbsp;</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","disability-cover","fanews","group-risk","isaac-mudau"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"group benefits disability claims: addressing changes brightrock last two years have been challenging work front all south africans businesses sizes were severely tested by pandemic financial uncertainties many forced close their doors permanently others had downsize employee numbers salaries battle survive tough economic conditions still remains real course business only element affected covid 19 people losing salaries they also loved ones these exacerbated families threat breadwinner getting seriously ill worse passing away this really brought value risk cover fore some people death that have claims metlife’s 2021 benefit trends study found 51% employees believed employers should play greater role safety protection families policies delivered promises – association savings investment africa (asisa) revealed paid increased 139% period 1 april &#8211; 30 september 2021 compared same 2019 pre covid over 94 000 category paid during third wave covid 19 totalling r1252 billion payouts undoubtedly saved families would received any money ones otherwise however with sharp increase claims came great deal uncertainty about what future bring sector terms further deaths result pandemic even more claims reaction increase anticipation large payouts insurers premiums which members scheme seldom good thing ideally suited solution funds are now looking out ways ensure adequately covered cost can bear against backdrop economy under strain where efficient insurance designed limit wastage flexible enough meet clients’ changing needs make difference schemes members need gives them most when they’re younger pay cheques protect less older one insurer’s innovative product design example give groups 40% scheme whole addition event claim insurer options available allow claimant decide whether want take payout lump sum recurring payment launched its 2018 course could predicted environment than double year put jeopardy match people’s needs provides distinct advantage both employers employees backdrop article originally published page 87 fanews 2022 edition attributed isaac mudau chief operating officer: funeral risk click here  read original version &nbsp; &nbsp; content staging news disability cover group risk isaac mudau"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7179,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7585,"date":"16 Mar, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"BrightRock&#8217;s 2021 payout equal to all claims paid in its first 7 years in business","excerpt":"<p>In 2021, BrightRock paid as many death claims as it did in the first seven years of its existence.

The young life insurer, in which Sanlam acquired a majority stake in 2017, covers almost 2 million lives, but it paid out R1.25 billion in claims in one year. This was more than half of its total annualised premium income of R2.03 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the nine years to December 2021, BrightRock paid R3.6 billion in total claims. When excluding the 2021 claims, this amounts to less than R300 million in average claims per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the surge in claims was partly attributable to the growth in customers covered, BrightRock CEO Schalk Malan said on a &#8220;normal year&#8221;, the company would still expect to pay between R500 million and R600 million in claims. The pandemic thrust the insurer into a space it never imagined navigating so early in its lifespan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wave three, the Delta variant, was really significant, especially on our individual underwritten life business,&#8221; said Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other insurers, BrightRock found the Omicron wave less severe in terms of claims, despite bringing the highest infections with it. BrightRock is preparing for a fifth wave in the middle of the year, but this doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s that&#8217;s the last rise in Covid-19 infections it&#8217;s expecting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Can we guess and say multiple waves? I think Covid-19 will become part of life in due course, like common flu,&#8221; said Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that thanks to its &#8220;robust&#8221; reinsurance and support from its majority shareholder – Sanlam – the company has sufficient capital to navigate this challenging period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The problem is that you can&#8217;t really plan for waves… But we feel confident that we are in a positive space,&#8221; added Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like big insurers, BrightRock is reviewing its underwriting policies for the unvaccinated. The insurer wants to make sure that the new business it writes and premiums it offers clients are sustainable in the face of the unknown Covid-19 risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not because insurers are trading back. We are not saying because we paid out R1.25 billion of claims last year, we&#8217;ve got to make it up. Those costs have been accounted for. This is more about the outlook going forward and how things will be normalising,&#8221; said Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growing market share as people shop around</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the rude awakening regarding claims in 2021, BrightRock is determined to grow its market share even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021 the total cover that its individual life, group risk, and funeral cover customers had in place exceeded R380 billion, up by 8.5% from 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The insurer said it seems that the pandemic has made people think differently about life cover. They have been buying more. But they are cash-strapped and are looking for a Rolls Royce on a Polo budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan believes this is Brightrock&#8217;s time to shine because its &#8216;needs-matched&#8217; insurance &#8220;eliminates a lot of wastage&#8221;. So it&#8217;s looking to take an even bigger slice of market share from established insurers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We eliminate a lot of waste because, with other insurers, people buy some cover that&#8217;s not needed later down the line. We are sitting in a very unique situation as a business,&#8221; said Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The insurer said its market share has doubled over the last four years in terms of new business sales. The company used to sell its insurance only through independent brokers. But it has now built its own adviser force to only sell Brightrock&#8217;s products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article was originally published on Fin24 on 15 March 2022. <a href=\"https://b2bcentral.co.za/issues/2022/moneymarketing/May/\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","business-performance-results","claims","covid-19","lovechange","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"brightrock&#8217;s 2021 payout equal all claims paid its first 7 years business brightrock 2021 many death did seven existence young life insurer which sanlam acquired majority stake 2017 covers almost 2 million lives out r125 billion one year rand terms business insurer said third wave driven by delta variant hit individual clients particularly hard despite this bad experience early history wants take more market share from big insurers than half total annualised premium income r203 billion nine december r36 claims when excluding claims amounts less r300 average per although surge partly attributable growth customers covered ceo schalk malan &#8220;normal year&#8221; company would still expect pay between r500 r600 pandemic thrust into space never imagined navigating lifespan &#8220;wave three really significant especially our underwritten business &#8221; malan like other insurers found omicron wave severe bringing highest infections with preparing fifth middle year doesn&#8217;t mean &#8217;s that&#8217;s last rise covid 19 expecting &nbsp; &#8220;can guess say multiple waves think will become part due course common flu &#8221; he added that thanks &#8220;robust&#8221; reinsurance support shareholder – sufficient capital navigate challenging period &#8220; problem can&#8217;t plan waves… feel confident are positive space &#8221; reviewing underwriting policies unvaccinated make sure new writes premiums offers sustainable face unknown risks &#8220; because insurers trading back saying &#8217;ve got those costs have been accounted about outlook going forward how things normalising &#8221; growing people shop around rude awakening regarding determined grow even more cover life group risk funeral had place exceeded r380 billion 85% 2020 &nbsp; seems made differently cover they buying cash strapped looking rolls royce polo budget believes time shine &#8216;needs matched&#8217; insurance &#8220;eliminates lot wastage&#8221; bigger slice established &#8220; eliminate waste because buy some needed later down line sitting very unique situation doubled over four sales used sell only through independent brokers now built own adviser force products article originally published fin24 15 march 2022   click here  read original online version content staging news business performance results lovechange schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7239,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7583,"date":"15 Mar, 22","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Needs-matched life insurer BrightRock announces growth in 2021, despite a challenging time for the life insurance industry","excerpt":"<p>Needs-matched life insurer, BrightRock, today provided an update on its business performance results across its individual life, group risk, and funeral businesses for the fiscal year ending 31 December 2021.</p>\n","illustration":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"needs-matched-life-insurer-brightrock-announces-growth-in-2021-despite-a-challenging-time-for-the-life-insurance-industry","content":"\n<p><em><strong>Key Performace Indicators </strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Total cover in force across its individual life, group risk and funeral businesses exceeds R380 billion, up by 8.5% from 2020, with total annualised premium income now at R2.03 billion</li><li>Total claims paid of more than R1.2 billion in 2021 alone – total claims paid to date of more than R3,6 billion (as at 31 December 2021).

BrightRock, too, saw a significant increase in claims during the course of last year with the number of death claims in its individual life business increasing by 200% in 2021,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Consumers place more emphasis on the importance of life cover</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on the previous 12 months and the effects of the COVID-19 Delta and Omicron variants</p>\n\n\n\n<p>on the industry, Malan says that, while it has been a difficult time for the industry and for BrightRock, it has also provided insurers with the opportunity to live up to their promise to their clients at a time when clients need it the most – when they claim. According to the recent <a href=\"https://cdn.remarkgroup.com/gcs/GCS2021-22-Reconnect-Life_EN.pdf\">ReMark&#8217;s 2021 Global Consumer Study</a>, 56% of South African life insurance consumers surveyed had a more positive view of life insurance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The same study found that 38% of the South Africans surveyed in the study increased the value of their life insurance cover in 2021. The study included responses from 12&nbsp;807 consumers across 22 insurance markets around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strong new business growth and record numbers of claims paid</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the difficult market conditions, BrightRock delivered industry-leading growth in 2021. According to Malan, BrightRock experienced strong growth in annualised premium income (API) in 2021, with a 11,35% year on year increase in total API. &#8220;To date, BrightRock has paid out a total of R3,6 billion (as of 31 December 2021) in claims since we sold our first policy in 2012, with R1.2 billion paid out across our business (individual life, group risk, and funeral offerings) in 2021 alone. This is the same as the total amount we paid in claims during our first seven years in business,&#8221; says Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Efficient life insurance is more important than ever before</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking about BrightRock’s individual risk product, Malan said &#8220;Although more people recognise just how important life insurance is, many of them are also earning less money than they did before the pandemic<a href=\"https://cdn.remarkgroup.com/gcs/GCS2021-22-Reconnect-Life_EN.pdf\">, with nearly one in three people experiencing a significant reduction in their income since the start of the pandemic</a>. This emphasises the importance of efficient life insurance, which allows clients to cover as much of their needs as possible for a cost-effective premium. This is, of course, something we&#8217;ve always known at BrightRock. Our needs-matched product not only precisely matches our clients’ needs, but also adds efficiency and certainty to their lives.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock has seen significant growth in the independent adviser space in terms of new business cover sold, with its market share doubling over the last four years. The widespread adoption of BrightRock’s needs-matched product design is evident in the fact that the company received one-quarter of the cover written in the large policy segment by independent financial advisers in the market in 2020. This is according to the SwissRe Individual Volume Survey for 2020 (released at the end of 2021), which also showed that BrightRock was able to provide clients with an average of 32% more cover for the same premium than the rest of the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;According to the same SwissRe survey, the fact that BrightRock can give clients more cover for the same premium has contributed to us having the highest share of new business cover written by independent financial advisers during 2020. This is a trend that continued into 2021, with the NMG Survey showing continued new business sales growth for BrightRock,&#8221; says Malan. &#8220;As a company, we are constantly looking for ways to provide even more certainty to our clients when their needs change, and the figures mentioned above, as well as our growth over the last decade, demonstrate the role we’re able to play in our clients&#8217; lives,&#8221; Malan concluded.</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","press-releases"],"tags":["brightrock","business-growth","business-performance-results","needs-matched","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["budgeting-for-the-future-how-life-insurance-policies-and-savings-plans-work-hand-in-hand","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes","brightrocks-2021-payout-equal-to-all-claims-paid-in-its-first-7-years-in-business","sas-life-insurance-sector-where-do-the-opportunities-lie-for-2022-and-beyond"],"searchString":"needs matched life insurer brightrock announces growth 2021 despite challenging time insurance industry insurer brightrock today provided update its business performance results across individual life group risk funeral businesses fiscal year ending 31 december 2021 key performace indicators total cover force risk exceeds r380 billion by 85% from 2020 with annualised premium income now r203 billion claims paid more than r12 2021 alone – date r36 ( 2021) this brightrock’s product ranked 3rd terms market share (by premium) new written independent financial advisers represents 134% adviser space once again fastest growing insurer* cover) note: figures are according nmg distribution monitor: south africa underwritten all channels_brightrock;

There have been changes, for example, in financial regulations, technology, distribution channels, and consumer behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Financial regulations in South Africa change constantly,</strong>&nbsp;as our industry is informed by the frequent changes in international insurance markets. These regulatory changes seek to improve the sustainability, transparency, and conduct of large financial services institutions to protect consumers. In addition to responding to the impact of the pandemic, several regulatory and technology-led changes are changing the insurance landscape. These include the new IFRS 17 standard and the Twin Peaks model for financial regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SA life insurance sector has also had to keep up with the&nbsp;<strong>global shift to digital channels</strong>, which has affected how both individuals and business behave. With this shift, there are now greater expectations from customers in terms of service delivery. While we are seeing several insurers starting to digitise customer journeys, significant opportunities still exist to accelerate this in many markets. To meet the rising demand for digital solutions, Insurtechs, which are technology-led companies in the insurance sector that aim to provide coverage to a more digitally savvy customer base, have been quick to step in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because consumers have become more digitally savvy, and because there has been a transition from a sales to advice mindset, as well as improved market conduct regulations,&nbsp;<strong>insurance distribution channels have also evolved</strong>. Brokers and agents remain the most prominent channels, although direct sales and bancassurance &#8211; arrangements between a bank and an insurance company allowing the insurance company to sell its products to the bank&#8217;s client base – have increased their share. Since our market entry, we have seen a vast increase in the number of tied-adviser and direct-to-consumer channels in the market, alongside the continued growth of the Independent Financial Advisor (IFA) market, with a notable increase in the professionalism, advice focus, and value-add of intermediated channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have also been&nbsp;<strong>significant changes to consumer behaviour</strong>&nbsp;over the past decade as consumers have become more familiar with the digital journey in purchasing services and products online. Technology is also an enabler of personalisation and customisation. Consumers are much more aware and demanding, preferring personalised insurance covers instead of the one-size-fits-all products currently available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Predictions for the life insurance industry over the next decade</strong><br>Bearing in mind the recent evolution we have seen in the life insurance industry, here are five future trends we at BrightRock believe will inform the direction of the sector in the next few years:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Putting strategies in place to tackle the next challenge that comes along:</strong>&nbsp;Our industry has definitely risen to the unprecedented situation that the pandemic has created. We have all stepped up to ensure our clients remained well protected during a time when they needed us the most. We are proud of how our industry has been agile enough to adapt to the changes brought on by COVID-19 and are looking forward to seeing what the next 10 years hold for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Accessibility to long-term insurance for more people:</strong>&nbsp;As an industry, the next 10 years presents us with an opportunity to ensure that we make long-term insurance more accessible to more people. This means restructuring life policies to help people better understand what their cover is for. It also means cutting out unnecessary waste, to ensure people pay only for what they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Demystified products:</strong>&nbsp;The next five to 10 years is an opportunity for us to work harder at demystifying our products for more South Africans, and clearly communicate the benefits that long-term insurance can bring to families and individuals. One of the lessons from this pandemic should be the importance of long-term policies, as these make provision for times of financial hardship, such as a debilitating illness or the death of a breadwinner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. A huge focus on financial literacy and education:</strong>&nbsp;Financial education is one of the areas that will be a key emphasis for the industry for the next few years. Financial education increases consumers’ financial capability and so contributes to the demand for financial products, transparency, and fair market conduct. Financial literacy is also a key factor in ensuring sustainable and effective financial inclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Treating customers fairly:</strong>&nbsp;A big focus for the industry in the coming years will be how financial institutions treat their customers. The past decade has seen the introduction of various pieces of legislation to regulate financial institutions&#8217; conduct and strengthen oversight of how the financial services industry treats its customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The life insurance industry has always been an exciting, ever-evolving sector and has brought many changes over the past few years that have served both the industry and consumers well. We at BrightRock are looking forward to playing an important role in the future of our sector, and are confident that our dynamic, needs-matched approach, which matches the cover to the shape and trajectory of the underlying financial needs, will continue to lead the way in revolutionising the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article was originally published on FAnews on 28 February 2022 <em>and is attributed to <em><em>Schalk Malan BrightRock </em>CEO</em></em>. <a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/article/life-insurance/9/general/1202/sa-s-life-insurance-sector-where-do-the-opportunities-lie-for-2022-and-beyond/33971\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","life-insurance","lovechange","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"sa’s life insurance sector: where opportunities lie 2022 beyond brightrock south africa one most competitive markets world with mature established industry serving middle upper income clients emerging sector when comes sector that serves clients sector delivering innovative solutions previously unserved lower income markets major contributor soundness stability african economy recent&nbsp;

One key aspect of budgeting is saving, and it is an element often neglected, as the cost-of-living increases and our short-term-gratification culture dominates. In July 2021, the South African Reserve Bank reported that households were spending three-quarters of their take-home pay on debt. The need to budget and save have become even more critical over the past two years with many people having lost their job or income during the hard lockdown in 2020, and it’s important that we take control of our finances to ensure a better future for ourselves and those dependent on us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Life insurance and savings are part of your financial plan for the future</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you think of your savings plan, life insurance is not likely to be the first thing you associate with saving up for what is important to you. Most people see life insurance as a grudge purchase, something that you only benefit from should something serious happen to you, or even worse, if you should die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to have both life insurance and savings plans, as they each safeguard your future in different ways. Life insurance is necessary to protect you and your loved ones should anything happen to you and you can no longer provide for the family, while savings are critical in helping you prepare for unexpected expenses such as an emergency vehicle repair, fund larger future needs such as your retirement, and keep your debt to a minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the surface, life insurance doesn’t seem to have much to do with those financial goals you set yourself. But it’s important to see life insurance, disability and critical illness cover, and your savings as important vehicles that work hand in hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ensure you structure your insurance cover efficiently so you can have more left over for savings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your life insurance policy should be structured so you’re managing your premiums as efficiently as possible, paying as little as you can for adequate life cover, so you have additional amounts available to supplement your savings. Getting needs-matched cover is key so that you can ensure that you’re not overpaying for cover that you don’t need, and for a period of time that you don’t need that cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example of overpaying for insurance is cover that would pay out to look after your children if you were to pass away. You only need this cover until they’re expected to become financially independent, so you should never take out whole of life cover to cover this need, as you’ll be paying for cover after the period that the need comes to an end. Also, because the cover term is one of the factors that insurers take into account when pricing cover, you’ll pay more from the first premium for cover that’s expected to last for a longer period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Evaluate your portfolio regularly</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to set up regular sessions with your financial adviser to reassess your financial portfolio and make changes if necessary. For example, perhaps you took out some life insurance a few years ago to pay off your bond in case you became disabled or passed away. You recently came into an inheritance, however, and have since used this money to pay off your bond. Because you no longer need this cover for your bond, it is a good idea to move that cover to an area in your policy where you are possibly underinsured, or to move that amount into a savings vehicle like your retirement policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be aware that a critical illness or disability can drain your savings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical illness has an important link to savings. For example, you could become disabled in a car crash and need to make multiple changes to your house, such as ramps and modifications to your bathroom and kitchen. If you don’t have cover in place for this, the money will need to come from somewhere and unfortunately that will mean digging into savings. A small emergency fund will not be enough to pay for the significant additional expenses that could arise from a serious illness or injury, so it’s a good idea to ensure you’ve got critical illness cover on your life insurance policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A financial adviser can help you</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Making the wrong decision can have serious consequences for you and your family, so it’s worthwhile to shop around for the best advice. Fortunately, many well-qualified financial advisers can answer your questions, provide clear explanations, and help you understand what you’re buying when it comes to life insurance. Financial advisers must meet strict regulatory requirements and be properly licensed with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and product providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve been thinking about your savings and how best to plan for your future financially, then there is no time like the present to take action. Look for online recommendations for financial advisers or ask people you know who they trust their money matters with. Start your savings plan today – your future self will thank you for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article was originally published on FAnews on 22 February 2022 <em>and is attributed to Clyde Parson, BrightRock </em>Chief Innovation Officer. <a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/article/life-insurance/9/general/1202/budgeting-for-the-future-how-your-life-insurance-policy-and-savings-plan-work-hand-in-hand/33915\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["news"],"tags":["brightrock","budgeting","clyde-parsons","consumer-education","savings"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"budgeting future: how your life insurance policy savings plan work hand brightrock this week our minister finance enoch godongwana will delivering his budget speech which outline government’s planned expenditure over next year godongwana highlighting what areas need – such housing education healthcare government intends prioritising terms much they are allocating each sector now although ’s probably given that don’t have access billions rands does principle planning monthly annual should apply everyone who earns income one key aspect saving element often neglected cost living increases short term gratification culture dominates july 2021 south african reserve bank reported households were spending three quarters their take home pay debt save become even more critical past two years with many people having lost job income during hard lockdown 2020 important take control finances ensure better future ourselves those dependent us part financial when think plan likely first thing associate saving most see grudge purchase something only benefit from serious happen worse die both plans safeguard different ways necessary protect loved ones anything can longer provide family while helping prepare unexpected expenses emergency vehicle repair fund larger needs retirement keep debt minimum surface doesn’t seem goals set yourself insurance disability illness cover vehicles hand structure cover efficiently left structured ’re managing premiums possible paying little adequate additional amounts available supplement savings getting needs matched overpaying need period time cover good example would out look after children pass away until they’re expected financially independent never whole ’ll comes end also because term factors insurers into account pricing premium that’s last period evaluate portfolio regularly regular sessions adviser reassess make changes necessary example perhaps took some few ago bond case became disabled passed recently came inheritance however since used money bond bond idea move area where possibly underinsured amount like retirement policies aware drain link could car crash multiple house ramps modifications bathroom kitchen place this come somewhere unfortunately mean digging small enough significant arise injury ’ve got policy help products pretty complicated making wrong decision consequences worthwhile shop around best advice fortunately well qualified advisers answer questions clear explanations understand buying insurance must meet strict regulatory requirements properly licensed sector conduct authority (fsca) product providers been thinking about financially then there present action online recommendations ask know trust matters with start today self thank article originally published fanews 22 february 2022 attributed clyde parson brightrock  chief innovation officer   click here  read original version news clyde parsons consumer education"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":21918,"pull_quote":"\"Traffic and soaring petrol increases are a painful reality, and the new workforce has grown used to a greater degree of flexibility in their working arrangements.\"","type":["expert"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7577,"date":"1 Dev, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Hybrid is the future","excerpt":"<p>ReMark&#8217;s recently released Global Consumer Study for 2021 &#8211;

The name of this year&#8217;s global consumer study is &#8216;ReConnect Life&#8221;, which, as ReMark says, &#8220;is not just a nod to the life insurance industry, but ultimately to how we are, in a special way, closer than ever through this collective challenge.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The need for life insurance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the important findings of the ReMark study is that people&#8217;s views on life cover have been influenced considerably because of the events of the past 18 months. According to the GCS, 40.2% of people have changed their attitude to risk and the value of insurance. Of these individuals, 71.8% had had a friend or family member pass away from Covid-19 and 58.1% had tested positive or were closeto someone who had tested positive for the virus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study also identified that 67.9% of those surveyed had increased theirlife or health insurance cover, and 35.5% had bought life insurance, as a result of Covid-19. In South Africa, 37.9% of respondents who said that their attitude towards risks and the value of insurance had changed as a result of Covid-19, actually increased their life insurance. As the pandemic highlights the fragility oflife, the importance of having sufficient cover to care for your loved ones becomes far more stark.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why and how do people buy insurance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ReMark research also identified the most effective marketing channels for the insurance industry globally. Of the survey respondents who said that they had bought insurance, 31.4% did so because friends and family recommended it and 28.7% did so after a consultation with an insurance agent. Therefore, 60.1% of these respondents purchased life cover because of their interactions with people, rather than through advertising efforts &#8211; only 15.5% were influenced by seeing an online advert, 13% as the result of a TV advert and 7.5% because of an advert in the newspaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respondents also sought out advice from the experts, rather than relying solely on their own research. Of those who did buy cover, 75.7% had obtained professional advice during the process, 60% of whom went to an insurance agent or adviser, or an independent adviser. To put the coverin place, 62.9% used an adviser, compared to only 4.2% via an internet comparison website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way individuals interact with advisers has changed since the pandemic began, however. Covid-19 has accelerated what was already a solid trajectory towards digital and now people are engaging with advisers and insurers via social media, websites, and email. Consultations are more frequently being done virtually, as people opt for its convenience and safety. ReMark&#8217;s GCS found that 83.1% of South African respondents were more likely to prefer using digital services where possible, as compared to 49.9% who said the same last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move toward a hybrid insurance experience from the ReMark research, then, it is clear that people still trust people when it comes to buying insurance. Although a few individuals may opt for ads or internet comparisons, recommendations from people they know and from professionals still come out tops. The pandemic has made us appreciate connection even more, especially in showing empathy, and the personal touch is still key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financialadvisers remain very valuable in our space, and that&#8217;s a trend Iforesee well into the future. With the accelerated move towards online, combining a human adviser with a digital platform that can be used effectivelyto show people how to protect their risksis undoubtedly a winning formula. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published in FIA Insight – Quarter 4 – 2021 on 1 December 2021 and is&nbsp;attributed to&nbsp;Sean Hanlon, BrightRock Executive Director: Sales and Distribution</em>.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://fia.org.za/Publication/Issues/quarter4/index.html#p=28\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","fia-insights","global-consumer-study-gcs","hybrid","life-insurance","sean-hanlon"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"hybrid future brightrock remark&#8217;s recently released global consumer study 2021 &#8211; 2022 some interesting insights into how trends that saw beginning pandemic have evolved (gcs) which largest life insurance includes south africa its list surveyed countries name this year&#8217;s &#8216;reconnect life&#8221; which remark says &#8220; just nod insurance industry ultimately are special way closer than ever through collective challenge &#8221; need one important findings people&#8217;s views cover been influenced considerably because events past 18 months according gcs 402% people changed their attitude risk value insurance these individuals 718% had friend family member pass away from covid 19 581% tested positive were closeto someone who virus also identified 679% those increased theirlife health cover 355% bought result covid 19 africa 379% respondents said towards risks covid 19 actually highlights fragility oflife importance having sufficient care your loved ones becomes far more stark why buy research most effective marketing channels industry globally survey they 314% did friends recommended 287% after consultation with agent therefore 601% purchased interactions people rather advertising efforts only 155% by seeing online advert 13% tv advert 75% newspaper sought out advice experts relying solely own research 757% obtained professional during process 60% whom went agent adviser independent adviser put coverin place 629% used compared 42% via internet comparison website way individuals interact advisers since began however accelerated what already solid trajectory digital now are engaging insurers social media websites email consultations frequently being done virtually opt convenience safety gcs found 831% african likely prefer using services where possible 499% same last year move toward experience research then clear still trust when comes buying although few may ads comparisons recommendations know professionals come tops made us appreciate connection even more especially showing empathy personal touch key financialadvisers remain very valuable our space that&#8217;s trend iforesee well future online combining human adviser platform can effectivelyto show protect risksis undoubtedly winning formula article originally published fia insight – quarter 4 1 december &nbsp;attributed &nbsp;sean hanlon executive director: sales distribution &nbsp; click here&nbsp; read original version content staging news fia insights global consumer study gcs life insurance sean hanlon"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":17374,"pull_quote":"","type":["tool"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7568,"date":"22 Nov, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"What factors affect the cost of your life insurance premium?","excerpt":"<p>Your health plays a role in the price of your premium, as does your lifestyle.</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Factors-that-afftect-the-costs-of-your-insurance-premium-scaled.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"what-factors-affect-the-cost-of-your-life-insurance-premium","content":"\n<p>A life insurance premium is a monthly payment you make to your insurer in exchange for your life cover. There are a few aspects that influence the cost of this premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The younger you are, the cheaper your premium is.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is always a good idea to take out life insurance when you are young. Not only are you and your loved ones protected early on, but your premium is cheaper. This is because you represent less of a risk to the insurer, and you are more likely to be in better health. Also, the earlier you start paying for life insurance, the more affordable your premiums will be when you are older, provided you make sure that the premiums remain affordable over the years. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your health plays a role in the price of your premium, as does your lifestyle.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have certain health issues or have suffered from a severe illness or injury, then the cost of your premium will most likely be higher. You could also be subject to certain exclusions on your policy. The monthly amount you pay for your life insurance policy is also influenced by your lifestyle. For example, do you have a job that is considered dangerous, such as being a police officer? Or do you frequently enjoy participating in activities that have a high likelihood of injuries, such as sky diving or rock climbing? Being a smoker or vaper can also result in you paying a much higher premium, as this is a risk to your health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your life insurance premium depends on the duration you need the cover for, and how much cover you want.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With life insurance, you can have different layers of cover within your policy, for example, an amount that covers long-term expenses like a bond. When that bond is paid off, though, you no longer need that layer of cover, which can reduce your premium. Your monthly premium also depends on how much cover you want. As a general rule, the more cover you take out, the higher the premium. It is best to talk to a financial adviser about how to balance what you can afford to pay each month and how much life insurance you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Before taking out a life insurance policy, make sure you know how much your future premiums will be.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When taking out life cover, you need to consider not just what you will be paying now, but what you will be paying in the future. Some policies offer cheap premiums in the short term but may require you to pay much more as you get older. It is a good idea to consider what kind of increases you think you will be able to afford in the future. For example, if your salary only goes up by 5% every year, an annual premium increase of 15% is not affordable. Life insurance cover is designed to be a policy that you keep for an extended period, so it isn’t ideal to have to change providers regularly, so when you do change your life insurance provider, it&#8217;s important to understand how much you&#8217;ll be paying in the long-term. Your life insurer is required to include premium projections in your insurance quotation, so be sure to ask for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A financial adviser can help you</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Making the wrong decision can have serious consequences for you and your family, so it’s worthwhile to shop around for the best advice. Fortunately, many well-qualified financial advisers can answer your questions, provide clear explanations, and help you understand what you’re buying when it comes to life insurance.

Life insurance is necessary to protect you and your loved ones should anything happen to you, while savings are critical in helping you prepare for unexpected expenses and keep your debt to a minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your life insurance and savings are part of your financial plan for the future</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you think of your savings plan, life insurance is not likely to be the first thing you associate with saving up for what is important to you. Most people see life insurance as a grudge purchase, something that you only benefit from should something happen to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the surface, life insurance doesn’t seem to have much to do with those financial goals you set yourself. But it’s important to see life insurance, disability and critical illness cover, and your savings as important vehicles that work hand in hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Ensure you structure your insurance cover efficiently so you can have more leftover for savings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your life insurance policy should be structured so you’re managing your premiums as efficiently as possible, paying as little as you can for adequate life cover so you have additional amounts available to supplement your savings. Getting needs-matched cover is key so that you can ensure that you’re not overpaying for cover that you don’t need that cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Evaluate your portfolio regularly</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to set up regular sessions with your financial adviser to reassess your financial portfolio and make changes if necessary. For example, perhaps you took out some life insurance a few years ago to pay off your bond in case you became disabled or passed away. You recently came into an inheritance, however, and have since used this money to pay off your bond. Because you no longer need this cover for your bond, it is a good idea to move that cover to an area in your policy where you are possibly underinsured or to move that amount into a savings vehicle like your retirement policies. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be aware that a critical illness or disability can drain your savings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical illness has an important link to savings. For example, you could become disabled in a car crash and need to make multiple changes to your house, such as ramps and modifications to your bathroom and kitchen. &nbsp;If you don’t have cover in place for this, the money will need to come from somewhere and unfortunately, that will mean digging into savings. A small emergency fund will not be enough to pay for the significant additional expenses that could arise from a serious illness or injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A financial adviser can help you</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Making the wrong decision can have serious consequences for you and your family, so it’s worthwhile to shop around for the best advice.

Insurance gives you peace of mind that your loved ones will be taken care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You don’t need the same amount of cover throughout your life</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your cover should change as your needs change. For example, the insurance needs of someone with young children versus the insurance needs of someone with no dependants and nearing retirement are very different. Life insurance is mostly about protecting your future paycheques, and replacing your income if you aren’t there, so it makes sense that you would need more cover the more paycheques you need to protect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some elements of life cover are no longer necessary when you retire</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you retire, disability cover is no longer necessary, as you aren’t earning an active income anymore and don’t have any paycheques to protect. Even after you stop earning an active income, though, you still need some life insurance to cover expenses like funerals and deathbed costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You should link your life insurance cover to the period that you need it for</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With life insurance, you are aiming to cover certain long-term expenses that you have, such as a bond on a property or school fees for your kids. Not all of these needs and expenses have the same duration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, though, that expenses like your bond are for a fixed period, so you shouldn’t still be covering them on your policy when they are paid off, or there is no longer a need for them.

Underwriting is a key element of life, critical illness, and disability insurance. It forms the basis of what premiums you pay and what you are covered for. Underwriting helps the insurer decide what the level of risk is for them to cover you. In other words, what the likelihood is that you will claim and when you will claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Underwriting involves sharing details about your lifestyle and health</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To tailor your cover and decide what premium you should be paying, insurers will require detailed information from you. This kind of information usually involves questions about your health, your lifestyle habits, and your family medical history. Most insurers will also need you to have some minor medical tests done, such as blood tests. These are usually done at no cost to you and at a place and time convenient for you. Non-underwritten cover does not require as much information, and therefore usually has higher premiums, as you are riskier for the insurance company to insure because they know less about your health and lifestyle, and when they can expect you to claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Having fully underwritten cover means your premiums and level of cover are more accurate</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Undergoing the underwriting process allows you to know when the policy starts that you’ll be covered in full from day one and that the premium you are paying is appropriate. Some people want to avoid the underwriting process because they believe the results of their medical tests, or their medical history might exclude them from cover on certain conditions. Although this can occur with certain insurers, it’s also important to note that these pre-existing conditions might be excluded anyway on a policy where no, or limited, underwriting has been done – this is called a pre-existing exclusion clause. Alternatively, you may need to pay a higher premium to have these conditions covered on a policy with full underwriting. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It’s important to share as much information as you can during the underwriting process</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes underwriting can seem a bit overwhelming, as there can be many questions to think about and answer. Bear in mind, though, that your insurer is asking for essential information that can help them assess what cover they can give you. Even something that you may think is minor can be important. Share as many details as you can and be truthful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A financial adviser can help you</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be complicated.

Eighteen months of uncertainty, loss and adaptation. Our lives have changed, both personally and professionally, and we are only now returning to some semblance of normality, albeit in a very different world. But despite all this turmoil, the indomitable strength of South Africans has shone through, and we have turned many of the difficulties brought on by COVID-19 into opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The life insurance industry has been one of those sectors that has risen to the challenge that the pandemic has created and stepped up to ensure its clients remained well protected during a time when they needed us the most. I have seen this particularly in the group risk and funeral cover areas of our business and been proud of how our industry has been agile enough to adapt to the changes brought on by COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The opportunity to better understand our clients’ needs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the ways that the pandemic has changed our industry is that it has emphasised the importance of sitting down with our clients and getting to understand what they need most from our products and indeed from us as a sector. All life insurance companies have seen a dramatic increase in claims since early last year, particularly in the funeral and group risk space, as mortality rates in our country have risen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The industry could have buckled during this high claims period, and its reserves and resources were tested. However, what we saw instead was that our industry is resilient and sustainable, and that it is committed to servicing clients and meeting their needs. At BrightRock, for example, we have nearly two million lives on our books for funeral cover, and we wanted to ensure that we kept paying claims within 48 hours so that we could lessen the devastating burden placed on families. It also became even more critical for us to do more than just underwriting the policies and settling claims. We increased our focus on regularly liaising with the funeral parlours as they assisted their clients with the claims requirements. In this way, we were able to keep in touch with what our clients need from us. The pandemic demonstrated the importance of having cover, resulting in an uptick in the number of new clients, an increase in the number of beneficiaries on policies, and more clients wanting to enhance their cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The opportunity to redesign our products</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the pandemic highlighting how critical it is to have cover, the insurance industry has also seen how important it is to focus on the design of our products, our pricing and our distribution. Now more than ever, we need to be focused on careful monitoring and reporting, ensuring that we fully understand how our clients’ cover performs for them. This enables us to refine our views on how we price products and ensure that they are distributed correctly through the right channels and to the right people. The industry has started devoting more focus to improving our client’s experience of the journey of our products, and that is of immense value to policyholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The opportunity to engage with our clients differently&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the effects of our recent crisis is that businesses and wallets have been hit hard. Many people have lost their jobs, companies have had to downsize or close their doors and consumers have tightened their belts. As insurers, it was key to anticipate this economic impact and recognise that for businesses and consumers, less revenue meant the diminished ability to service policies. For the group risk sector, we at BrightRock started engaging with individual employer groups to understand their unique challenges, especially in those industries that were likely to be hard hit by the pandemic’s ripple effect. We then implemented solutions relevant to each industry, such as reduced cover for a certain period, so that employers could sustain their cover. In this way, companies were still able to provide for their employees and their families during the crisis, who also avoided a situation where they would have undergone additional underwriting should their policies lapse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 shone a spotlight on the importance of cover, and our sector has been able to show how they can assist policyholders at a time when having insurance is critical. We have had to adapt to the circumstances that have been created for us, and clients have seen the benefits of an industry that can be agile and meet their needs. The pandemic has allowed us to engage with our clients on a different level, and be more analytical about our products and how we communicate about them. As an industry, we have the strategies in place to tackle the next challenge that comes along, whether it be the next wave or another obstacle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><em>This article was originally published on Cover &#8211;

People now spend most of their lives online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More people opt for video calls instead of in-person consultations, and browse websites, insurance comparison platforms and social media to get information. New policies are even being initiated via WhatsApp, digital signatures for counteroffer letters are now commonplace, and tele-underwriting has become more regular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, digital technologies are only relevant to the extent that they are supporting your ability to deliver on your purpose, which is to add value to people&#8217;s lives by helping them navigate life insurance products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The nature and scope of the products</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent data shows that people are seeking out advice more than ever. According to ReMark&#8217;s Annual Global Consumer Study for 2020, 42.2% of insurance clients said that they trusted automated services less than human advice. This is up significantly from 33.5% in 2019. For most people, having someone to think with, who can help them figure out what matters most to them, to work through financial complexity with them, and to provide them with some certainty, is more necessary than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, research has also indicated that there seems to be a trust deficit between advisers and consumers. People&#8217;s finances are more under pressure now than ever before, and many consumers feel they have been let down by both private and public<br>institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer indicated that financial services remains the least-trusted sector at just 57% trust among the general population. And, this was before COVID-19. Despite advisers&#8217; and product providers&#8217; best effor ts, many clients often reluctantly pay premiums without comprehending the nature and the scope of the products they sign up for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What needs premiums are covering</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help close this trust deficit it is key that you, as an adviser, can show clients in real terms what needs are covered by their life insurance, and for how much. For example, for Income Protection, you can allocate what clients spend on their household needs, childcare needs, and healthcare needs and what amount they would need to have protected. In the case of cover for a severe ilIness or injury, you can look at what they will recover from, what is permanent and what is covered by death. Using someone&#8217;s budget makes the situation quite real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approaching the process from an income protection perspective, rather than looking at a specific amount of cover, is a good way to highlight to clients what needs their premiums are covering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clients are far more receptive when they understand how you got to these numbers and it is more likely that they will buy cover and keep it, as the importance of this insurance is more evident. This is very much a co-creation process, where you and your client are crafting a policy together, based on their specific needs and that suits them as an individual. This is needs-matched cover at its best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The real &#8216;why&#8217; of insurance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurers need to support financial advisers with user-friendly , informativ e interfaces that allow them to access information, explain products and run quotes. There needs to be enough intelligence in the background to support the advice process, while at the same time, facilitating client interaction and participation. Simply put, we as product providers need to give you the tools to highlight the &#8216;why&#8217; of insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An example here is an online quoting application. The platform would enable you, the adviser, to co-create an individualised, needs-matched insurance solution on-screen, with the client viewing and inputting on the quote generation process. Using this type of quoting platform will facilitate your ability to genuinely interact with clients, shedding light on the complex terms and conditions that sometimes tend to alienate consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what forms the basis of a solid relationship with clients and puts you in a good position to gain your clients&#8217; trust and recommend products that tick all the boxes that matter most. And that is the real &#8216;why&#8217; of insurance &#8211; to add value to people&#8217;s lives and cover them and their families.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>T<em>his article first appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/publication/pdf_257_fanewsoct2021\">page 52 of the FAnews October 2021 magazine</a>&nbsp;a<em>nd is&nbsp;attributed to <em>Sean Hanlon, BrightRock Executive</em>&nbsp;Director</em></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","fanews","insurance","sean-hanlon"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"examining ‘why&#8217; insurance brightrock when compared ten years ago world life significantly different place navigate people nowadays spend majority their time online very space navigate ago now most lives more opt video calls instead person consultations browse websites comparison platforms social media get information new policies are even being initiated via whatsapp digital signatures counteroffer letters commonplace tele underwriting become regular however technologies only relevant extent that they supporting your ability deliver purpose which add value people&#8217;s by helping them navigate products nature scope products recent data shows seeking out advice than ever according remark&#8217;s annual global consumer study 2020 422% clients said trusted automated services less human advice this from 335% 2019 people having someone think with who can help figure what matters them work through financial complexity with provide some certainty necessary research also indicated there seems trust deficit between advisers consumers finances under pressure ever before many consumers feel have been let down both private public institutions 2019 edelman barometer remains least trusted sector just 57% among general population before covid 19 despite advisers&#8217; product providers&#8217; best effor ts often reluctantly pay premiums without comprehending sign needs covering close key adviser show real terms covered insurance how much example income protection allocate household needs childcare healthcare amount would need protected case cover severe iliness injury look will recover from permanent death using someone&#8217;s budget makes situation quite real approaching process protection perspective rather looking specific cover good way highlight covering far receptive understand got these numbers likely buy keep importance evident much co creation process where client crafting policy together based suits individual needs matched its best &#8216;why&#8217; insurers support user friendly informativ e interfaces allow access information explain run quotes enough intelligence background while same time facilitating interaction participation simply put providers give tools insurance example here online quoting application platform enable co create individualised solution screen viewing inputting quote generation process type facilitate genuinely interact clients shedding light complex conditions sometimes tend alienate forms basis solid relationship puts position gain clients&#8217; recommend tick all boxes matter most &#8211; families t his article first appeared &nbsp; page 52 fanews october 2021 magazine &nbsp; nd &nbsp;attributed sean hanlon executive &nbsp;director content staging news sean hanlon"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":21793,"pull_quote":"\"Even if it’s just a few rands a month, putting a little aside teaches children to plan for the future.\"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7529,"date":"25 Oct, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Why is naming beneficiaries on a life insurance policy so important?","excerpt":"<p>When considering who to nominate as beneficiaries, most people choose people who are financially dependent on them. </p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Beneficaries-Image.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"why-is-naming-beneficiaries-on-a-life-insurance-policy-so-important","content":"\n<p><strong>Your beneficiaries will receive the money from your life insurance when you pass away</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you take out a life insurance policy, you need to choose who will receive the insurance pay-out when you die. The person who receives the money from your life insurance policy is your beneficiary, and you can even name more than one beneficiary. Deciding who to choose as your beneficiaries is a very personal decision and different people will make different choices, based on their individual situation. Most people choose a close family member, such as their spouse, their life partner, their children, or their parents, as their beneficiary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can nominate anyone you choose to be your beneficiary</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering who to nominate as beneficiaries, most people choose people who are financially dependent on them. You can nominate any adult over the age of 18 years to be your beneficiary. You can also nominate a child under the age of 18. However, it’s important to understand that, under South African law, a child doesn’t have the legal capacity to inherit money or any other assets directly. Instead, a legal guardian will need to administer any money your child receives from your life insurance policy until the child reaches the age of 18 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Legal experts often advise that parents set up a testamentary trust in their will to ensure that their children will receive the pay-outs from your life insurance policy, or any other money left to them. A testamentary trust is a legal trust that is created on your death. Should you die, any money paid out from your life insurance policy will be paid straight into the trust. The trustees that you have appointed to administer the trust will manage this money in the best interests of the child until they turn 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose how you want the pay-out to be divided between your beneficiaries. For example, a 50/50 split between two family members or a 40/20/20 split for your spouse and both your parents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can change beneficiaries at any time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a good idea to review your life insurance policy annually or at least after certain important events, such as when you get married. You can change the beneficiaries of your life policy at any time. Simply contact your insurance company or financial adviser to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you don’t name a beneficiary, the money from your life policy will be paid into your estate</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your estate is all your money and possessions, including your debts, that you leave behind when you die. After you die, your estate has to be wound up, which means that any debts must be paid off and any assets must be distributed to the people who need to inherit from your estate. If the money from your life insurance policy is paid into your estate, it could take many months – or even years – for the money to be paid out to your loved ones. When you have people who depend on you financially, this could mean that they might not be able to keep the same lifestyle as they had when you were alive. Once the money is paid into your estate, if you owe anyone money, they could also claim this debt from your estate. If you do name beneficiaries, however, then they will receive a payment as soon as your death claim gets approved, which is usually quite quick if the death claim is easy to finalise. What’s more, no one else can claim against this pay-out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A financial adviser can help you</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Making the wrong decision can have serious consequences for you and your family, so it’s worthwhile to shop around for the best advice. Fortunately, many well-qualified financial advisers can answer your questions, provide clear explanations, and help you understand what you’re buying when it comes to funeral policies and life insurance. Financial advisers must meet strict regulatory requirements and be properly licensed with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and product providers.&nbsp; You have the right to ask your adviser for their credentials and ask whether they are independent or work for a specific product provider.</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","just-for-you"],"tags":["brightrock","consumer-education","lets-get-smart-about-life-insurance"],"relatedPosts":["just-for-you-do-you-need-life-insurance","just-for-you-what-is-life-insurance-and-how-does-it-work","budgeting-for-the-future-how-life-insurance-policies-and-savings-plans-work-hand-in-hand","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes"],"searchString":"why naming beneficiaries life insurance policy important brightrock when considering who nominate beneficiaries most people choose are financially dependent them your will receive money from pass away take out policy need pay out die person receives beneficiary can even name more than one beneficiary deciding very personal decision different make choices based their individual situation close family member such spouse partner children parents anyone beneficiary any adult over age 18 years also child under 18 however ’s important understand that south african law doesn’t have legal capacity inherit other assets directly instead guardian administer until reaches years experts often advise that parents set testamentary trust ensure children pay outs left created death should die paid straight into trust trustees appointed manage this best interests they turn how want divided between beneficiaries example 50/50 split two members 40/20/20 spouse both parents change time good idea review annually least after certain events get married time simply contact company financial adviser this don’t estate all possessions including debts leave behind wound which means debts must distributed estate estate could many months – loved ones depend financially mean might able keep same lifestyle had were alive once owe money claim debt then payment soon death gets approved usually quite quick easy finalise what’s more else against pay out help products pretty complicated making wrong serious consequences family worthwhile shop around advice fortunately well qualified advisers answer questions provide clear explanations what ’re buying comes funeral policies insurance meet strict regulatory requirements properly licensed with sector conduct authority (fsca) product providers &nbsp; right ask credentials whether independent work specific provider content staging just consumer education lets get smart about life insurance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":9300,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7499,"date":"19 Oct, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"What you need to know about insurance fraud","excerpt":"<p>BrightRock’s head of the legal team, Glenn Hickling, has addressed some questions to educate consumers about insurance fraud and how it applies to them. </p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Insurance-Fraud-018.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"what-you-need-to-know-about-insurance-fraud","content":"\n<p>The recent court case against former policewoman Rosemary Ndlovu has put insurance fraud under the spotlight. Ndlovu is accused of plotting the murder of relatives so that she could claim on several insurance policies. BrightRock’s head of legal, Glenn Hickling, answers questions on insurance fraud and how it applies to consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is insurance fraud and what are some of the most common methods?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GH: Insurance fraud is a deliberate act of deceit – such as withholding material information or providing false information – to benefit unlawfully from an insurance policy. Insurance fraud can be committed against an insurance company or an agent of the insurance company. The perpetrators of fraud may include people applying for cover, policyholders, third-party claimants and beneficiaries, and service providers, as well as intermediaries or employees. Some of the most common forms of fraud are padding or inflating insurance claims, providing false information on an insurance application, or submitting false claims. Extreme cases of fraud may involve staging an accident, faking an injury or death, or syndicate schemes where professional fraudsters coordinate and execute complicated fraud strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How prevalent is insurance fraud in SA?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GH: Unfortunately, fraud is quite prevalent and is on the rise. According to statistics released in August 2021 by the Association for Savings and Investment South Africa (Asisa), there was a 12% increase in fraudulent life insurance claims from 2019 to 2020. Last year 3 186 such claims, totalling R587.3 million, were recorded, compared with 2 837 claims (R537.1 million) in 2019. The highest incidence of long-term insurance fraud last year (2 282 claims) was in funeral policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Insurance Crime Bureau estimates that in 2019 up to 20% of the R35 billion paid out on short-term insurance claims could have been fraudulent. This means that in 2019 alone the South African short-term insurance industry lost almost R7 billion to fraud. South African life insurance companies are seeing a surge in fraudulent claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What makes people vulnerable to insurance fraud?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GH: Most insurance clients would never consider submitting a fraudulent insurance claim. However, industry statistics suggest that people are more likely to commit insurance fraud in times of economic hardship. As seen from the ASISA statistics above, over the past year, insurers have experienced a dramatic rise in fraudulent behaviour, indicating that the tough economic conditions have led more people to commit some form of insurance fraud. A recent example we’ve come across is the submission of fraudulent funeral policy claims where the death certificates have been falsified. We’ve also seen an increase in cases of non-disclosure, where we find that clients have misrepresented or held back information about their health or financial risks when applying for cover. In the case of funeral insurance, it is somewhat easier for fraudsters to try their luck, as these policies don’t require any medical reports or blood tests to pay out and pay out far more quickly than a life insurance policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What measure can consumers take to prevent a fraudster from taking out insurance policies in their name?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GH: Identity theft is a common problem in South Africa, and internationally, cybercrime is on the rise, exacerbating the problem. It’s therefore vital for people to protect their personal and financial information. This includes not sharing your ID number and other personal information with an unauthorised person, not clicking on suspicious links, and keeping your financial documents and information secure. If you suspect that you may have been the victim of identity theft, notify the authorities immediately. Should you discover that any insurance or other financial product has been taken out in your name without your consent, immediately notify the company in question. It’s also a good idea to regularly check your bank statements and payslips. If you spot any debit orders or deductions, you’re unfamiliar with, notify your bank or your company’s HR department immediately and the financial service provider in question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What measures have insurance companies put in place to prevent insurance fraud?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GH: Insurance companies have a wide range of fraud prevention and detection strategies in place and many of the large insurers have advanced forensics teams in-house to identify and investigate fraud. In recent years, digital technology has enabled insurers to become even more sophisticated in their fraud prevention strategies, using artificial intelligence and Big Data to pick up any inconsistencies, incomplete or inaccurate information or suspicious behaviour. Digital technologies can also be used to verify information, and insurers can cross-check details against industry databases, and social media. Many fraudsters believe that insurance fraud is a victimless crime, but the truth is that fraud is detrimental to all parties, including other policyholders, who may face increased premiums due to the impact of such financial crimes. Insurers will therefore act swiftly to decline a fraudulent claim, claim back any money paid out because of fraud or dishonesty and, institute criminal charges where this is justified, resulting in substantial fines and even a prison sentence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can a person commit insurance fraud without knowing they are doing it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GH: Yes, a person can commit insurance fraud unwittingly. Many people believe that it’s harmless to exaggerate their income to receive a higher insurance payout, leave out information about previous claims or their health status when applying for cover, or to add extra items on their long-term insurance theft claim. In the life insurance space, we often find that people leave out important information about their medical history or lie about their smoker status. While this may seem like a harmless white lie, it has a very real impact on the person’s risk profile, the cover they can get and the premium they pay. The truth, therefore, is that this kind of dishonesty is fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If a person commits insurance fraud, what are the consequences? Will they be blacklisted or possibly face jail time?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GH: If an insurer learns that a policyholder has committed fraud, their claims will be repudiated, they will become uninsurable, and they may even be criminally prosecuted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What actions can consumers take to avoid committing insurance fraud?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GH: As with so many things in life, honesty is the best policy. This means being open and honest in your dealings with your insurance provider, answering their questions accurately and comprehensively when signing up for cover. If anything changes, make sure that you keep your insurance provider up to speed. An insurance contract is founded on mutual trust and disclosure. The insurance provider trusts that you will share all the information they need to be accurately able to assess and insure your risk, while you trust the provider to pay your valid claims if you have held up your end of the bargain. If you’re not sure about the information you need to provide, it’s best to ask your insurance provider or to speak to a trustworthy professional financial adviser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where can consumers report insurance fraud?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GH: If you become aware of fraud related to your insurance cover, there are several ways to report it. Many insurers have a forensic unit dedicated to investigating fraud, and you can report anything suspicious to them confidentially. If you prefer to report fraud anonymously, many insurers have independently operated whistle-blower hotlines, where you can safely report your suspicions. You can also report insurance fraud to the police, or to the Insurance Crime Bureau, a non-profit, voluntary organisation dedicated to fighting organised criminal activity and fraud in the insurance industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published on IOL Personal Finance on 17 October 2021 and is&nbsp;<em>attributed to Glenn Hickling, Head of Legal,

its impact on women of all races, nationalities, and socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Breast-Cancer.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"women-breast-cancer-and-life-insurance-what-you-need-to-know","content":"\n<p>During October every year, the medical fraternity highlights breast cancer and its effect on women of all races, nationalities and social circumstances. Besides its health impacts, breast cancer can also cause financial worries for families, something that your life insurance policy can help you manage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What causes breast cancer?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA), breast cancer is the most common cancer in South Africa, affecting one in 28 women. In urban communities, the incidence is as high as one in eight, according to our National Health Laboratory statistics. Several factors contribute to your likelihood of developing breast cancer. Firstly, lifestyle plays a major role — being overweight, eating unhealthily, not exercising regularly, drinking too much alcohol, smoking and stress can all put you at higher risk. The risk also increases significantly as you age. Your family history can also play an important role, with certain types of breast cancer having a strong genetic link. Actress Angelina Jolie made headlines a few years ago when she chose to have a prophylactic double mastectomy. Although she hadn’t been diagnosed with breast cancer, she tested positive for the BRCA1 breast cancer gene, which had caused her own mother’s early death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Regular self-examination and breast cancer screening</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, in most cases of breast cancer, regular screening can lead to early detection. And the earlier cancer is detected, the easier it is to treat. That’s why women of all ages need to do regular self-examinations, checking their breasts for any changes, lumps or bumps.<a href=\"https://parysgazette.co.za/58104/women-breast-cancer-and-life-insurance-what-you-need-to-know/#_ftn1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;In addition, doctors recommend that women over the age of 40 should have yearly mammograms. There are two types of lumps: benign (not cancerous) and malignant (cancerous). Benign lumps in the breast are often fibroadenomas, which are made up of fibrous and glandular tissue and duct papillomas. Adenomas, made up of glandular tissue, are most often benign but can turn malignant. Malignant tumours of the breast are either ductal or lobular carcinomas. With ductal carcinoma, there is a 75% chance that it may spread, while lobular carcinomas have only a 10% chance of spreading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The costs of breast cancer treatment</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of breast cancer treatment varies depending on the stage and aggression of the cancer. Treatment could include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. All medical schemes provide coverage for treatable breast cancer (subject to certain maximum limits), as it’s one of the Prescribed Minimum Benefits. Your level of coverage will depend on your medical aid option. Many medical aids offer coverage for related expenses like the cost of a wig during chemotherapy, the cost of breast prostheses and, in some cases, the cost of reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy. However, where women opt for treatment with some of the more expensive biological drugs or any form of experimental treatment, medical schemes may decline funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Life insurance and breast cancer cover</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life insurance can help you pay for additional expenses that may arise from cancer treatment that medical aids don’t cover, or if you don’t have medical aid. There are some aspects of life policies you should be aware of, though, especially if you have a family history of breast cancer or poor lifestyle habits. A good financial adviser will be able to advise you on the different options available to you in terms of protecting yourself against the financial impact of breast cancer. Be sure to speak to your financial adviser about these four key points when it comes to your critical illness cover for breast cancer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Additional expenses:&nbsp;Besides the costs of treatment covered by medical aid, there may be out-of-pocket medical expenses or additional costs that don’t relate directly to medical treatment. For example, the cost of hiring a driver or aftercare for your children while you are undergoing treatment. These unforeseen additional expenses that may result because of serious diseases like cancer costs can be covered by dread disease or critical illness cover in most life insurance policies.</li><li>Standalone cover:&nbsp;Many providers will reduce your cover for death or disability when you are paid out for a critical illness benefit, which cancer falls under. This could leave you exposed. Standalone cover for additional expenses mitigates this risk.</li><li>Cover for preventive surgery or early detection: Most insurance providers will only pay you out for the later stages of cancer. Some providers sell separate products that provide coverage at the earliest stages, stage 0 or stage 1 – but these may come at an additional cost.</li><li>Cover for progressions and multiple claims: Because cancer is a progressive disease, and certain breast cancers are fairly aggressive, it’s possible that the cancer may return after treatment.&nbsp; However, some dread disease products still offer only one lump-sum pay-out to fund additional expenses.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The thought of you or your loved ones going through breast cancer can be scary, but it is important to stay informed about prevention, treatment, costs and insurance so that you can be prepared for most eventualities. Speak to your financial adviser for guidance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://parysgazette.co.za/58104/women-breast-cancer-and-life-insurance-what-you-need-to-know/#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> This information can be found on the CANSA website – <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://scanmail.trustwave.com/?c=20371&amp;d=9-7W4bhS3GGdyvegK5sksD1HnBRAMewqxMrGLnmmTw&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fcansa%2eorg%2eza%2fwomens-health%2f%23%3a%7e%3atext%3d1%2e%2cNational%2520Cancer%2520Registry%2520%28NCR%29\" target=\"_blank\">https://cansa.org.za/womens-health/#:~:text=1.,National%20Cancer%20Registry%20(NCR).</a>    </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This article was originally published on The Parys Gazette on 3 October 2021 and is <em>attributed to Clyde Parsons, Chief Innovation Officer, BrightRock</em></em>.<em> <a href=\"https://parysgazette.co.za/58104/women-breast-cancer-and-life-insurance-what-you-need-to-know/\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</em></strong></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","cancer","clyde-parsons","the-parys-gazette"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"women breast cancer life insurance: what need know brightrock every october medical community raises awareness about its impact women all races nationalities socioeconomic backgrounds during october year fraternity highlights effect nationalities social circumstances besides health impacts can also cause financial worries families something that your insurance policy help manage causes cancer according association south africa (cansa) most common africa affecting one 28 women urban communities incidence high eight our national laboratory statistics several factors contribute likelihood developing cancer firstly lifestyle plays major role being overweight eating unhealthily exercising regularly drinking too much alcohol smoking stress put higher risk risk increases significantly age family history play important role with certain types having strong genetic link actress angelina jolie made headlines few years ago when she chose have prophylactic double mastectomy although hadn’t been diagnosed cancer tested positive brca1 gene which had caused her own mother’s early death regular self examination screening fortunately cases lead detection earlier detected easier treat that’s why ages self examinations checking their breasts any changes lumps bumps [1] &nbsp;

The awards, held for the players by the players, aim to celebrate South Africa’s top professional rugby talent, acknowledging those who have not only excelled in the sport but have also embodied rugby’s indomitable spirit over the past year. The winners are true ambassadors for their sporting code, having displayed characteristics such as commitment, resilient determination, and pure talent during one of rugby’s most unpredictable seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Highlights of this year’s awards</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, 30 players were nominated across seven award categories. After a short absence from the 2020 awards, the popular Fans’ Choice category made a welcome return this year, allowing fans to have their say. The winner of this year’s Fans’ Choice Award, Duane Vermeulen, has secured a boost of R30,000 for Rugby’s caring hands, The Chris Burger Petro Jackson Players’ Fund. Another exciting feature of this year’s ceremony was the nomination of two professional women’s rugby players, with Lusanda Dumke receiving the LoveChange Award for Most Improved Player, just a month after being appointed captain of the Springbok Women’s team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lusanda Dumke said of her remarkable accomplishment, <em>&#8221; It means a lot to me as an individual player, but it also means a lot to professional women&#8217;s rugby as a whole. This victory, in my opinion, demonstrates that we, as South Africa&#8217;s professional women&#8217;s rugby team, are doing a fantastic job. We are grateful for all of the wonderful support we have received in recent months and can assure South Africans that this is only the beginning for us. We are already looking forward to achieving more victories for South African women&#8217;s rugby at next year&#8217;s awards!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s nominees and winners represent a diverse mix of players from around the country, which showcases just how strong South Africa’s pool of rugby talent is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“We are proud to continue our partnership with BrightRock. Without them, these awards would not have been possible. We are thrilled with the outcome of this year’s awards and the opportunity to recognise and reward the unrivalled talent that South African rugby has to offer.

A memorable moment of the evening occurred when South Africa&#8217;s professional rugby players donated R140 000 from their collective income to the Chris Burger Petro Jackson Players&#8217; Fund via MyPlayers. This fund helps rugby players who have suffered catastrophic head, neck, or spinal cord injuries on the field. Professional rugby players have contributed a total of R170 000 to rugby&#8217;s caring hands through this donation to the Player&#8217;s Fund and the money pledged by Vermeulen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fans can catch the BrightRock Players Choice Awards broadcast on SuperSport tonight</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While today’s virtual event was an exclusive, by-invitation-only affair, rugby-lovers – and anyone who loves the celebrity power, glitz, and glam of an entertainment-filled awards show – can watch the event on SuperSport Channel 201 and 211 at 20H00 this evening, 23 September 2021.

Your life policy can also include a funeral cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Funeral cover is paid out quickly, whereas life cover can take longer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the nature of what they cover, funeral policies are paid out soon after the claim is made, usually between 24 to 48 hours of the insurer getting all the necessary documentation. Insurers know that, in the case of funerals, time is of the essence. With life insurance, the payment may take a bit longer, depending on the type of claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funeral policy payments are most often paid as a lump sum, whereas life cover can be paid in a lump sum, monthly, or a combination of the two. This depends on the type of policy that you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Both of these types of cover are about putting less financial strain on families</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With funerals, you would like to be able to give your family members a dignified send-off that doesn’t pressurise you financially. The last thing you need to worry about when planning a funeral is wondering how you will pay for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, life insurance covers your family during a difficult time, whether it be because of your death or because you are seriously ill or become disabled. Life insurance aims to ensure your loved ones have the same standard of living after something happens to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It’s best to have both life insurance cover and funeral cover</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because life insurance policies and funeral policies cover different things, it’s best to provide for both in your monthly budget. The costs of funerals are important to plan for, but life insurance will give you and your family more financial security if something happens to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, remember that many life insurance policies include funeral cover, so you can buy both for one monthly premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A financial adviser can help you</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Making the wrong decision can have serious consequences for you and your family, so it’s worthwhile to shop around for the best advice. Fortunately, many well-qualified financial advisers can answer your questions, provide clear explanations, and help you understand what you’re buying when it comes to funeral policies and life insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial advisers must meet strict regulatory requirements and be properly licensed with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and product providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have the right to ask your adviser for their credentials and ask whether they are independent or work for a specific product provider.</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","just-for-you"],"tags":["brightrock","consumer-education","lets-get-smart-about-life-insurance"],"relatedPosts":["just-for-you-do-you-need-life-insurance","just-for-you-what-is-life-insurance-and-how-does-it-work","budgeting-for-the-future-how-life-insurance-policies-and-savings-plans-work-hand-in-hand","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes"],"searchString":"what difference between funeral cover life cover brightrock because insurance policies different things ’s best provide both your monthly budget costs while focused long term provides some ( cases all) involved with funeral these include things such burial cremation flowers transport groceries airtime insurance other hand aimed providing family term ensuring they are well taken care financially should something happen does only when die can also critically ill become disabled policy cover paid out quickly whereas take longer nature cover soon after claim made usually 24 48 hours insurer getting all necessary documentation insurers know that case funerals time essence payment may bit longer depending type claim payments most often lump sum monthly combination two this depends that have types about putting less financial strain families would like able give members dignified send doesn’t pressurise financially last thing need worry planning wondering how will pay similarly covers during difficult time whether death seriously aims ensure loved ones have same standard living happens &nbsp; funerals important plan more security also remember many buy one premium adviser help products pretty complicated making wrong decision serious consequences family worthwhile shop around advice fortunately well qualified advisers answer questions clear explanations understand ’re buying comes insurance must meet strict regulatory requirements properly licensed sector conduct authority (fsca) product providers right ask their credentials independent work specific provider content staging just consumer education lets get smart about life insurance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":22048,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7459,"date":"9 Sep, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"BrightRock: from zero to R2.1bn in premiums","excerpt":"<p>It’s taken 10 years, but the BrightRock team has turned its plan to shake up the life insurance industry into action.

Today, the company is the third-largest insurer in new business in SA</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>venture of their own, based on a new model for life assurance. Armed with a mantra about living and loving change, Schalk Malan, Sean Hanlon, Suzanne Stevens and Leopold Malan planned to use tech to offer needs matched products that would allow individuals to shift their financial solutions as their lives change. With that, BrightRock was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A decade on, the Sandton-based company employs 700 people, insures 2.8-million and has laid claim to nearly 15% of the total life assurance market in SA. It&#8217;s the third-biggest life insurer in new business written by independent brokers, behind only Momentum and Discovery &#8211; and then &#8220;just by a short little nick&#8221;, company CEO Schalk Malan tells the FM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the economic downturn brought on by Covid, new business grew 10.8% last year, with total annualised premium income up 12.5%, to R2.1bn. It&#8217;s a vote of confidence in an idea that was born when Malan, then divisional product manager at Discovery Life, started chatting to Hanlon(Discovery Life sales manager) and Stevens(head of marketing)about starting something new. At the time, life products were inefficiently priced, says Malan. Irrespective of how a client&#8217;s needs shifted and changed over time, their cover would grow largely in a block, matching inflation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team saw room for improvement. Working after hours &#8211; from 8 pm, often into the early hours of the morning &#8211; they started exploring their options. Satisfied that their products and numbers could work, they set out to overhaul the infrastructure of life insurance, the way the product was delivered to clients and the consumer experience as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant moving away from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to life insurance, where an individual&#8217;s needs are lumped into a single policy. Instead, they wanted to design life insurance tailored to customers&#8217; individual requirements, with flexibility that would allow them to change their cover if their circumstances changed. It&#8217;s made for a system that&#8217;s more cost-effective and sustainable as there&#8217;s no waste, says Malan, who believes BrightRock customers save between 30% and 40% on their premiums.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the individualised nature of the product, there&#8217;s a much greater role for advisers. This was informed, in part at least, by Hanlon&#8217;s experience building distribution lines for Discovery Life in the UK when the subprime lending crisis hit. &#8220;Just to see the devastation of the UK consumer was a Damascus moment for me. You saw this changein [the]consumer and compression of mistrust of big organisations. In my mind, from an advice-giving point of view everyone was talking about &#8216;disintermediation&#8217; and moving from advice into artificial intelligence,&#8221; he tells the FM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But if you look at where it was going, the more sophisticated a person&#8217;s portfolio was, the more they were fighting to hire advice, and you&#8217;ve seen that trend continue at an exponential rate – especially now &#8230; in this Covid period.&#8221; The problem, he says, is that advisers tended to present clients with &#8220;a one-dimensional block of cover with a payback of some sort &#8230; There was a total disconnect between the relevance of the Cover being bought[and]the efficiency of the cover.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, Hanlon saw &#8220;a big flight to high-advice sales, as opposed to designing products that are sexy to sell but really are quite irrelevant to a client&#8217;s needs&#8221;. Says Malan: &#8220;We came in with a product that could speak to efficiency and flexibility. Our growth is driven, I believe, by a significant fresh and agile distribution; it&#8217;s really taking brokers along and explaining the advice journey, and enhancing their service offering and embracing technology.&#8221; The product itself is built around client needs for the short, medium or long term, between a death. &#8220;You get far better bang for your buck. When you outlive the financial need you bought cover for, you have an asset in the premium you pay, which you can then use to buy more cover. If you haven&#8217;t claimed on your policy, you can buy more, say, dread disease cover,&#8221; says Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a more practical level, the company has leveraged technological advancements to create completely customised insurance policies for clients, including in the group risk and funeral insurance markets. A tele-underwriting service has put paid to paper-based questionnaires, there&#8217;s an online quoting platform and paperless application process, and personalised, interactive policy documents. The application platform is driven by technology that performs 1.5-million calculations in a fraction of a second to deliver a needs-matched product and premium to a prospective client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After hitting on their idea, the team needed backing from like-minded reinsurers and investors. To that end, they spent a year building their systems, working closely with their first shareholder, Lombard Insurance Company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years in, Sanlam bought a 53% stake of the company for just over R700m, putting the value of the group at nearly R1.5bn. (Sanlam now holds 58% of BrightRock&#8217;s equity, while Lombard remains a minority shareholder.) &#8220;[Sanlam]saw BrightRockwas having a significant impact on the market it was operating in,&#8221; says Malan. &#8220;It felt the product offered something different to what it sells in the broker space. We developed our own brand and distribution force; it was more agile and [Sanlam] felt we could maybe get into segments of the market it would not be able to access.&#8221; There&#8217;s an irony in having ditched a corporate only to end up with one of SA&#8217;s largest financial institutions as a major shareholder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does that mean BrightRock is headed back to the corporate mindset? Not at all, says Malan, adding that the team is very clear on BrightRock&#8217;s independence. &#8220;We have our own life licence; we don&#8217;t operate on any of [Sanlam&#8217;s] regulatory licences. BrightRock, if anything, is becoming stronger by the day,&#8221; he says. In Hanlon&#8217;s view, there&#8217;s something of the best of both worlds in the tie-up. &#8220;I think right now we have quite a nice blend,&#8221; he explains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a standalone business and Sanlam really values us as a team. It&#8217;s a fabulously exciting time, especially when your business is working and you don&#8217;t have this gripping pressure around your throat that you have as a start-up.&#8221; There are advantages, too, in maintaining the entrepreneurial edge. &#8220;As a founder-run business, the big difference is you just move so much faster, you&#8217;re so much more flexible,&#8221; says Malan. &#8220;The difference between a corporate and</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entrepreneurship is that fleet-footedness[that] makes you take on the establishment.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his view, BrightRock&#8217;s agility has given it a particular edge during the pandemic. At a time\\ when more people than ever before were thinking about mortality and morbidity, the business could respond quickly. With its products easily available in the digital space, BrightRock was able to capitalise on an uptick in the use of technology. And the flexibility of its product line meant clients could buy up more cover free of underwriting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Awareness among consumers is at a record high now, in terms of protecting their families&#8217; balance sheets. It&#8217;s been a horrible period, but it&#8217;s come with opportunities,&#8221; says Malan. But the pandemic has made for a particularly complex environment in which to operate, says Stevens. And unexpected, too, with the company paying out 30%-40% more in claims than it had anticipated &#8211; about R88Om.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What has been extraordinary for me is bringing different people together. We&#8217;ve had lots of great and heated debates as to how to approach some of the challenges,&#8221; says Stevens. It&#8217;s that level of engagement that makes her &#8220;confident that we can navigate whatever comes our way&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So has the entrepreneurial journey been worth it? Hanlon says he&#8217;s always had a burning desire to make a change and do something different. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to die not having tried to make that difference &#8230;We didn&#8217;t go out to start a little niche player; we wanted a fundamental change to the life assurance business and that was a big ask,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something amazing about the people who&#8217;ve built these amazing businesses because it&#8217;s the toughest thing you can ever do. You see your salary bill climbing with more than 700 people, then [there&#8217;s] Covid, and you get depressions in the market and all those things that go with being an entrepreneur. You can intellectualise it all you want, but until you&#8217;ve been there nothing can prepare you for it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, given the chance, would he do it all again? &#8220;It&#8217;s all a little bit like being a parent. The kids drive you mad and you want to run away, but you wouldn&#8217;t give it up for the world and I&#8217;m really proud of what we&#8217;ve done when I see our claims paying out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We changed the way products are constructed and we also changed the way policies are sold.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article was originally published on Financial Mail on 9 September 2021 <em>and is attributed to BrightRock</em>. <a href=\"https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/features/2021-09-09-brightrock-from-zero-to-r21bn-in-premiums/\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["10th-anniversary","financial-mail","schalk-malan","sean-hanlon","suzanne-stevens"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"brightrock: from zero r21bn premiums brightrock ’s taken 10 years team turned its plan shake life insurance industry into action today company third largest insurer new business sa sa venture their own based model assurance armed with mantra about living loving change schalk malan sean hanlon suzanne stevens leopold malan planned use tech offer needs matched products that would allow individuals shift financial solutions lives change that born decade sandton based employs 700 people insures 28 million laid claim nearly 15% total assurance market &#8217;s third biggest written by independent brokers behind only momentum discovery &#8211;

It’s a time where bad winter habits are finally broken and we can start new routines that prioritise health. But what about the health of your finances? When it comes to money matters, we often find ourselves focusing only on the rands and cents coming in and going out every month. It’s important, though, that we also consider our finances in the long term, and this is where life insurance comes in. It’s critical to review your cover regularly so that you ensure it’s keeping up to date with any relevant changes in your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schalk Malan, CEO at needs-matched insurer BrightRock, has the following advice on some things to think about when reviewing your cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>It’s not pleasant to do, but think about the whole picture and consider it in some detail</strong>. What your family does if you suffer a temporary illness or injury may differ substantially from what they might do when you die. If the insured event happens, will the family change its lifestyle, sell one car and sell the house to rent a flat instead? Once you’ve understood the potential impact of a specific insured event, consider each of your financial needs – this will give you a good idea of what risks you should prioritise, where you can afford to take some risk and where you need to be comprehensively covered.</li><li><strong>Don’t skimp on advice</strong>. Insurance products are complex by nature, and making the wrong choices could have far-reaching consequences for you and your family. Getting professional advice from a properly trained and accredited financial adviser is important. Ask questions, insist on clear explanations and shop around for the best advice. Take the time to understand what you’re buying.</li><li><strong>Know what you’ll be paying in the long term.&nbsp;</strong>Don’t just settle for the cheapest premium. It’s important to understand the funding pattern – how your insurance premium will be funded in the long term. Some funding patterns have a “buy now, pay later” structure that may make your cover cheap today but unaffordable in the long term. Make sure you understand the long-term implications of your choice, so you’ll be able to afford your cover when you most need it.</li><li><strong>Ask yourself how far your cover will go after an insured event happens.&nbsp;</strong>Life insurance is sold as a rand amount of cover, which often sounds like a lot of money if you don’t relate it to your financial needs. Say you have R1 million’s cover. If you are disabled and can’t work anymore, will that be enough to cover your family’s living expenses for years to come? If you die, how far will that R1 million’s cover go in meeting your family’s needs? Is it enough, close enough or not nearly enough?</li><li><strong>Don’t put the policy in the drawer and forget about it.&nbsp;</strong>That’s what most of us do when we’ve bought life insurance – but we forget that our life changes. Make sure you review your cover at least once a year but remember that if major life events happen, you might need to review it more often. If you’re starting a business, getting a raise, buying a new house or a big boat, getting married, having a child – these are events where your insurance might need to increase. And if you’ve paid off a major debt and your children have left home, you might be able to reduce your cover too and put your premiums to use elsewhere.</li><li><strong>Tell your insurer if your lifestyle changes.</strong>&nbsp;If you’re planning to live abroad for a few months, you’ve taken up an adventurous new hobby like quad-biking or you’ve just given up your job in the corporate law to become a scuba diving instructor – these are all lifestyle changes that may affect your insurance risk and your cover with your insurer. If you don’t tell your insurer about these changes and you later claim, this could affect how your claim is paid out. It’s best to let your insurer know when your health, your job, your country of residence or your hobbies and habits have changed substantially. That way you have peace of mind, knowing your cover and your premiums are correct and your claims will be paid. BrightRock does not require its clients to inform us of changes in hobbies or jobs, however, unless they’re to do with aviation.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Important events that should prompt you to review your cover</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Malan<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>there are several key milestones in life that may increase the level of financial risk that you or your dependants may face if you should suffer an injury or illness or die. These milestones include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Buying a major new asset that sees you incurring new debt, for example when you buy a house or a new car or take out a loan to start a new business;</li><li>Having or adopting a child or when there is a change in your dependents – for example, if you marry someone with children from a previous marriage, your financial obligations may increase substantially;</li><li>Getting married, again because your lifestyle and financial obligations may increase;</li><li>A significant increase in income – for example, if you’re promoted and your salary increases substantially, your lifestyle will probably improve and your insurance cover needs will therefore increase;</li><li>A significant increase in the value of your estate – for example, if you inherit assets from a relative, this increases the value of your estate but will also increase the estate duty payable on your estate.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan says, “If you fail to review your cover when these major lifestyle events occur, you may find that your life insurance cover is inadequate to provide for the full extent of your or your beneficiaries’ actual financial needs at the time of your claim. BrightRock’s needs-matched life insurance policy is specifically made to the individual’s requirements, delivers better value for money and is presented in a format that is easy to understand. This empowers clients in that they can understand what it is they are buying now and in the future.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published on MoneyMarketing on 8 September 2021 and is&nbsp;<em>attributed to Schalk Malan BrightRock&nbsp;</em>CEO.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://moneymarketing.co.za/why-you-should-review-your-life-cover-regularly/\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","life-cover","money-marketing","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"why should review your life cover regularly brightrock spring time year when can finally break our negative winter habits begin new routines that prioritize health what about financial situation with september ushering spring there’s feeling renewal right now almost like are hitting ‘refresh’ button ’s where bad broken start prioritise health finances comes money matters often find ourselves focusing only rands cents coming going out every month important though also consider finances long term this insurance critical ensure keeping date any relevant changes life schalk malan ceo needs matched insurer brightrock following advice some things think reviewing cover pleasant whole picture detail family does suffer temporary illness injury may differ substantially from they might die insured event happens will change its lifestyle sell one car house rent flat instead once ’ve understood potential impact specific event each needs – give good idea risks prioritise afford take risk need comprehensively covered don’t skimp products complex by nature making wrong choices could have far reaching consequences family getting professional properly trained accredited adviser important ask questions insist clear explanations shop around best advice understand ’re buying know ’ll paying term &nbsp; just settle cheapest premium important funding pattern how premium funded term patterns buy pay later structure make cheap today unaffordable sure long term implications choice able most yourself far go after happens &nbsp; sold rand amount cover which sounds lot relate needs say r1 million’s disabled can’t work anymore enough family’s living expenses years come die meeting needs enough close nearly enough put policy drawer forget &nbsp; that’s us ’ve bought changes least remember major events happen more often starting business raise buying big boat married having child these increase paid debt children left home reduce too premiums use elsewhere tell lifestyle &nbsp; planning live abroad few months taken adventurous hobby quad biking given job corporate law become scuba diving instructor all affect insurer later claim claim out let health job country residence hobbies changed substantially way peace mind knowing correct claims paid require clients inform jobs however unless they’re aviation prompt according malan &nbsp; there several key milestones increase level dependants face include: asset sees incurring debt example buy loan business; adopting dependents example marry someone previous marriage obligations substantially; again because increase; significant income promoted salary increases substantially probably improve therefore value estate inherit assets relative duty payable estate says fail occur inadequate provide full extent beneficiaries’ actual claim brightrock’s specifically made individual’s requirements delivers better presented format easy understand empowers now future article originally published moneymarketing 8 2021 &nbsp; attributed brightrock&nbsp; ceo &nbsp; click here&nbsp; read original online version content staging news life cover money marketing schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7595,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text","image"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22052,"date":"6 Sep, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Do you need life insurance?","excerpt":"<p>A lot of people believe that the young don’t need life insurance.

Life insurance benefits include cover for death, disability, severe illness, or loss of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Life insurance cover ensures your loved ones are taken care of if you become ill, injured or pass away</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making sure you have life insurance cover is an investment in your family’s wellbeing. It will help you and your family meet your financial obligations, so you can maintain a similar lifestyle if something were to happen to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the type of cover you buy, your life insurance benefits will pay out a lump-sum or a monthly amount. Most life cover will pay out a lump-sum on your death to help cover the cost of your funeral, financially assist your dependents that rely on your income today, and settle debts, such as a home loan. Disability and income protection benefits will pay either a lump-sum or a monthly amount if you become disabled. Severe illness benefits usually pay a lump-sum to help you pay for extra costs that you may face if you become severely ill or injured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you earn an income, life insurance is essential</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people believe that the young don’t need life insurance. But the truth is, anyone who is earning an income needs to consider life insurance. Even if you are young and single, you may have expenses that need to be covered if anything were to happen to you. If you’ve recently bought a small flat, as an example, you might need life insurance to pay off your bond if you were to become disabled or pass away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, a young couple may need to take out life insurance policies to provide for each other, because they rely on both salaries to pay for their monthly expenses. Plus, life insurance typically becomes more expensive as you get older and are more likely to be sicker. That’s why it’s a good idea to take out cover now, when you’re young and healthy and qualify for a lower premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get financial advice to help you know what cover you need, and how much</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Making the wrong decision can have serious consequences for you and your family, so it’s worthwhile to shop around for the best advice. Fortunately, many well-qualified financial advisers can answer your questions, provide clear explanations, and help you understand what you’re buying. Financial advisers must meet strict regulatory requirements and be properly licensed with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and product providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have the right to ask your adviser for their credentials and ask whether they are independent or work for a specific product provider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are dissatisfied with the advice you have received, you have the right to file a complaint with the Office of the Ombud for Financial Services Providers (FAIS Ombud).

Although insurers take comparable approaches to providing cover, a new product on the market focuses on assisting customers in managing their illness.</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Diabetes.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"life-insurance-for-diabetics","content":"\n<p>For people living with diabetes, life cover can be expensive. The approach to providing cover is similar across insurers, but a new product on the market focuses on helping the customer to manage the condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To determine your life insurance premium, the insurer considers the risk factors they are presented with. “All risk factors are converted into the likelihood of claims related to death (extra mortality) or likelihood of disease, disablement or impairment (morbidity),” says John Kotze, an actuary at Old Mutual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Loadings – additional costs added to premiums for individuals with higher risk factors – are based on claims experience and data from national, global and insurance industry sources and are applied against each person’s unique circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The risk factors associated with diabetes are usually considered ‘high’,” he says. “Type two diabetes, for example, is a multi-factorial disease that may result in long-term complications. But diabetes-related risks are rated based on control, compliance and other lifestyle factors.” These risks differ from customer to customer, and Old Mutual’s risk-assessment practice takes various health indicators, including blood tests, into account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The final loading applied to someone who is diabetic can range from the lowest possible loading Old Mutual applies to any customer with a higher risk profile, which is typically around the 25% level, through to an outright decline,” Kotze says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, he adds that being diabetic does not necessarily mean that insurance cover is unaffordable. “In most instances, a low-risk diabetic (an individual whose diabetes is well controlled) will pay a lower insurance premium than a smoker.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At BrightRock, underwriting decisions could range from minimal premium loading to exclusions or declining cover entirely, depending on the client&#8217;s health, says chief executive Schalk Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any loadings applied are based on risk factors such as the applicant&#8217;s age, how long they&#8217;ve been diabetic, the type of diabetes they have, other health concerns, such as being overweight, and how well their condition is controlled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We ask the client to go for updated medicals, including blood tests, which provide us with a measure of their diabetes control,” says Malan. “We also request a full medical report and, depending on the applicant&#8217;s age, possibly a resting and effort ECG, and information from their treating medical practitioner&#8217;s files on how their condition has progressed over time. The better controlled their diabetes, the more likely it is that the client will have a more favourable outcome in the underwriting decision.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the client’s health improves and their diabetes is under control, and they provide updated medical information to this effect, BrightRock could consider lowering loadings or eliminating exclusions, Malan notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discovery Life bases the premium on the level of control of diabetes (using the HbA1c test, which reflects the average exposure to blood glucose over three months), and the related risk factors such as hypertension, lipids (cholesterol) and body mass index, says chief medical officer Dr Maritha van der Walt. The result ranges from a small loading to the decline of cover. For example, a pre-diabetic new client will attract a lower loading than a confirmed type-two diabetic, Dr van der Walt notes. Discovery Life rewards clients for keeping their diabetes under control, she adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During underwriting at Momentum Life Insurance, in most cases, diabetes is probably in the top five factors considered, along with factors like body mass index (BMI). Any combination of these increases the risk ranking significantly, says Janet Brodie, Momentum’s chief underwriting officer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The risk factors depend on the type of benefit required. “For example, well-controlled diabetes is less of a risk factor for mortality benefits than it is for critical illness benefits. Diabetes that is not well-controlled is a very serious risk factor for all benefits and the application is likely to be declined,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The most pertinent factors are the client’s age, how long they have been diabetic, how well they control their condition, what medicines they use, and whether they have any other conditions that contribute to their expected mortality, such as obesity and cardiac disease,” Brodie explains. “Some of these conditions that result in a loading for a non-diabetic client will lead to an even larger loading for the diabetic client. A client who has a less severe type of diabetes or who manages their condition well will receive more favourable terms compared to someone with the same profile but whose condition is uncontrolled and therefore a much higher risk.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New product</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, management and control of the condition is key to assessing the cost of life insurance premiums. With this in mind, Sirago has developed a life insurance product, Diabetic Life, which embeds a diabetes management programme into the policy benefits, at no additional cost to the policyholder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The programme, provided by Guidepost, provides the policyholder with access to a qualified diabetes coach on a one-on-one telephonic basis. At each call, the coach reviews the latest information and details available, including the latest blood glucose reading, and in turn provide individually tailored guidance and lifestyle tips. Data from the Guidepost patient support programme showed “an A1c reduction, good adherence and persistence to insulin therapy and high patient satisfaction”. They cite The UK Prospective Diabetes study: for every one percentage point reduction in HbA1c, the risk of diabetes-related deaths decreases by 21% and of heart attacks by 14%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep cover in place, adherence to the programme is mandatory, says Martin Rimmer, chief executive of Sirago Underwriting Managers. “Our partnership with Guidepost helps those living with diabetes improve their diabetes control over the long term, which in turn reduces the risk for the policyholder and insurer alike,” Rimmer says. In turn, this results in more affordable life insurance premiums and more effective cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The prevalence of diabetes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of cases of diabetes in South African adults amounts to over 4.58 million, which represents 12.8% of our adult population, according to April 2020 figures from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing a number of serious health problems, the IDF notes. “Consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to serious diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, nerves and teeth.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June this year, Statistics SA released the Mortality and Causes of Death in South Africa report for 2018, the latest processing cycle. Topping the list as the leading cause of death is tuberculosis (TB), followed by diabetes mellitus. However, though the proportion of TB deaths decreased over a three-year period (2016-2018), deaths due to diabetes increased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published on IOL Personal Finance on 13 September 2021. <a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/personal-finance/insurance/life-insurance-for-diabetics-what-you-need-to-know-997fd962-f2bd-4276-84af-d9d3e5b3a13d\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["iol","personal-finance","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"life insurance diabetics ‒ what need know brightrock might too expensive diabetics although insurers take comparable approaches providing cover new product market focuses assisting customers managing their illness people living with diabetes cover can expensive approach similar across insurers helping customer manage condition determine your premium insurer considers risk factors they are presented with all converted into likelihood claims related death (extra mortality) disease disablement impairment (morbidity) says john kotze actuary old mutual loadings – additional costs added premiums individuals higher based experience data from national global industry sources applied against each person’s unique circumstances associated diabetes usually considered ‘high’ he says type two example multi factorial disease that may result long term complications diabetes related risks rated control compliance other lifestyle factors these differ customer mutual’s risk assessment practice takes various health indicators including blood tests account final loading someone who diabetic range lowest possible mutual applies any profile which typically around 25% level through outright decline kotze however adds being does necessarily mean unaffordable most instances low risk ( individual whose well controlled) will pay lower premium than smoker brightrock underwriting decisions could minimal exclusions declining entirely depending client&#8217;s health chief executive schalk malan loadings such applicant&#8217;s age how long they&#8217;ve been diabetic type have concerns overweight condition controlled ask client go updated medicals provide us measure control also request full medical report possibly resting effort ecg information treating practitioner&#8217;s files progressed over time better controlled more likely have favourable outcome decision client’s improves under this effect consider lowering eliminating exclusions malan notes discovery bases level control (using hba1c test reflects average exposure glucose three months) hypertension lipids (cholesterol) body mass index officer dr maritha van der walt ranges small decline cover pre diabetic attract confirmed type two walt rewards clients keeping she adds during momentum insurance cases probably top five considered along like index (bmi) combination increases ranking significantly janet brodie momentum’s officer depend benefit required well controlled less factor mortality benefits critical illness benefits very serious all application declined pertinent condition medicines use whether conditions contribute expected mortality obesity cardiac disease brodie explains some non diabetic lead even larger client severe manages receive terms compared same profile uncontrolled therefore much risk clearly management key assessing cost premiums mind sirago developed product life embeds programme policy benefits policyholder programme provided by guidepost provides policyholder access qualified coach one one telephonic basis call reviews latest details available reading turn individually tailored guidance tips guidepost patient support showed a1c reduction good adherence persistence insulin therapy high satisfaction cite uk prospective study: every one percentage point reduction hba1c deaths decreases 21% heart attacks 14% keep place mandatory martin rimmer managers our partnership helps those improve term reduces alike rimmer turn results affordable effective prevalence number cases south african adults amounts 458 million represents 128% our adult population according april 2020 figures international federation (idf) increased developing problems idf consistently levels diseases affecting vessels eyes kidneys nerves teeth june year statistics sa released causes africa 2018 processing cycle topping list leading cause tuberculosis (tb) followed mellitus though proportion tb decreased three year period (2016 2018) due increased article originally published iol personal finance 13 september 2021 click here&nbsp;

Sasria is the only insurer in South Africa that covers riots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The riots underscored the importance of having insurance for other situations that SMEs can’t protect themselves against, such as fires and acts of nature. In addition to insuring the business’ physical assets, however, business owners also need to remember that they themselves are their company’s most important assets and should be covered too. Insurance becomes important when businesses and individuals experience some kind of loss, and no loss is more acute than that of the business owner. This is where life insurance comes in, in the form of contingent liability insurance for major debts, cover for buy-and-sell agreements and keyperson insurance.<br>However, the affordability of cover could be a stumbling block for many business owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Schalk Malan, Chief Executive Officer at needs-matched insurer BrightRock, traditional business assurance policies are more often than not structured in the same form as personal life insurance policies.<br>“There tends to be a single capitalised block of cover for all needs, and this cover is priced for the maximum term. This cover structure is not necessarily in the best interest of the small business owner, because the cover increases as your needs decrease – leading to cost inefficiency in the way premiums are structured.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why BrightRock decided to follow a more flexible approach, allowing business owners to invest more funds in their businesses, or allocate the savings to more cover in the event of underinsurance.<br>Malan explains: “By structuring business owners’ cover to meet their exact needs, you can remove premium waste and save money from the payment of their first premiums. This approach allows advisers to tailor business owners’ cover over time to match the profile of their needs.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what to do in the event where the business’ growth exceeds expectations, leaving the business owner with a desire to increase his cover? “Standard BrightRock policies automatically have access to an extra cover buy-up account, to access more cover later in the business’ lifetime without any medical underwriting,” notes Malan. Here is a summary of the kinds of long-term insurance that entrepreneurs should be thinking about for their company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Long-term insurance for a small business: What should be covered?</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Contingent liability insurance for major debts</strong></td><td><strong>Long-term insurance for buy and sell agreements</strong></td><td><strong>Keyperson insurance</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A shareholder of a company often has to sign surety as co-principal debtor or provide personal security for a loan taken out by the business. The business incurs a liability if this person becomes permanently disabled or dies, and business is unable to repay the loan.

It means you or your family will be able to lead the same lifestyle if anything should happen to you.&nbsp; If you die, life insurance cover will pay out some money, which can then be used to pay for things like your funeral and debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With disability, severe illness and income protection benefits, your financial needs are taken care of with either a once-off payment or a monthly payment. You can also take care of your children’s education needs should you die or lose your monthly income because you become very ill or disabled. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Life insurance is important if your family depends on your salary</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life insurance is often thought of as something you should only buy when you’re older. But even if you are young and single, it is an important thing to have. For example, if you as a 28-year-old have just bought a second-hand car, should something happen to you, it would make sense for you to have a some cover so that it could be paid off if you were to die. In the same way, a young couple should consider taking out life insurance policies for one another. This is because they rely on both salaries to pay for their monthly expenses. Something else to remember is that life insurance gets more expensive the older you get. So the earlier you start, the more affordable it will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Death and disability is something that can happen to anyone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also often forget that illnesses and accidents can happen to anyone of any age. A car accident, for example, is just as likely to happen to a young person as an older person. These events can result in death or permanent or temporary disability. Aside from the physical and emotional trauma caused by these events, they also mean a loss of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A financial adviser can help you</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance products can be pretty complicated. Making the wrong decision can have serious consequences for you and your family, so it’s worthwhile to shop around for the best advice. Fortunately, many well-qualified financial advisers can answer your questions, provide clear explanations, and help you understand what you’re buying. Financial advisers must meet strict regulatory requirements and be properly licensed with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and product providers.&nbsp; You have the right to ask your adviser for their credentials and ask whether they are independent or work for a specific product provider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are dissatisfied with the advice you have received, you have the right to file a complaint with the Office of the Ombud for Financial Services Providers (FAIS Ombud).

Women need life cover at every stage of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Starting out</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we’re young, we feel like we’re invincible. Why would we need life cover when we have few assets, no dependants, and are healthy? To a certain extent, it’s true. When entering the workforce, most people only really require enough life insurance to settle their debts and pay for their funeral. But where the real need comes in is with disability insurance. The most important thing women need to protect at this stage is their ability to earn an income; they still have a lifetime of pay cheques ahead of them and they need to safeguard them. While young women may not be as likely to suffer from a critical illness like cancer, they could still be in an accident, for example, which may impact their future earning potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Settling down</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For working women with families, in addition to ensuring they have disability cover, they also need to prioritise death cover. When women have financial dependants, they need to make provisions for those they leave behind should they pass away. Critical illness cover is key here too, as the likelihood of diseases increases with age, and unexpected costs may arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay-at-home mothers may not think that they need life cover, because they don’t earn an income. However, something that is often overlooked is the importance of temporary disability or impairment insurance. Should a stay-at-home mom become ill or injured and be unable to look after her children for a while, it could result in unexpected expenses for the family, such as the cost of day care or a transport service. Temporary cover would help to bridge this gap. As in the case with working moms, cover for critical illness is also key, again for those additional expenses associated with an illness or injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s vital that single mothers have comprehensive life insurance, to cover their family for all eventualities. Death, disability, and severe illness are all critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For working women in their 30s and 40s with no children or significant other, their focus should be on disability and critical illness. While they may think that, because they don’t have any dependants, they don’t really need life insurance, these women still have to protect their ability to earn an income. An amount of death cover will always be needed as well for those final expenses associated with passing away, like the cost of a funeral and any taxes that may be due.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Moving on up</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The general assumption around age and life insurance is that the older you get, the more death cover you need. However, the opposite is true. Usually, as people get older, their financial liabilities tend to decrease. You need less death cover as well as less disability cover as you have fewer pay cheques left to protect. What should go up for women in this life stage, though, is critical illness cover. Good health becomes far less of a certainty and cancers, heart problems and other diseases become more common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The golden years</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once women reach retirement age and start living from their retirement savings, they no longer need disability cover, as they are no longer actively earning an income. Critical illness insurance continues to remain a high priority in the golden years, as declining health becomes more likely. Death cover is only relevant here for funeral costs and death-bed expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like men, women’s life insurance needs will keep changing throughout their lives. It is in their best interests, then, to have cover that changes with them, so that they get the maximum benefit out of what they are paying for their life insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published on IOL Personal Finance on 26 August 2021 and is&nbsp;<em>attributed to Suzanne Stevens, BrightRock&nbsp;</em>Deputy CEO.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/personal-finance/insurance/why-women-need-life-insurance-cover-whatever-their-age-5eaaae57-364e-4068-952b-ebaea9879acf\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","insurance","suzanne-stevens","women"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"why women need life insurance cover whatever their age brightrock although make nearly half workforce seems that many still have long term cover cover every stage lives starting out when ’re young feel like invincible would few assets dependants are healthy certain extent ’s true entering most people only really require enough settle debts pay funeral where real comes with disability insurance important thing protect this ability earn income; they lifetime cheques ahead them safeguard them while young may likely suffer from critical illness cancer could accident example which impact future earning potential settling down working families addition ensuring also prioritise death financial provisions those leave behind should pass away key here too likelihood diseases increases age unexpected costs arise stay home mothers think because don’t income however something often overlooked importance temporary impairment mom become ill injured unable look after her children while result expenses family such cost day care transport service help bridge gap case moms key again additional associated injury vital single comprehensive insurance family all eventualities death disability severe critical 30s 40s significant other focus illness that any these amount will always needed well final passing away funeral taxes due moving general assumption around older get more need opposite usually get older liabilities tend decrease less fewer left protect what go stage though good health becomes far certainty cancers heart problems other common golden years once reach retirement start living savings longer actively continues remain high priority years declining likely relevant death bed expenses just men women’s needs keep changing throughout best interests then changes them maximum benefit paying article originally published iol personal finance 26 august 2021 &nbsp; attributed suzanne stevens brightrock&nbsp; deputy ceo &nbsp; click here&nbsp; read original online version content staging news suzanne stevens"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":11775,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7436,"date":"25 Aug, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"The BrightRock Players Choice Awards 2021 nominees","excerpt":"<p>Siya Kolisi, Damian de Allende, Cheslin Kolbe, Franco Mostert, Eben Etzebeth and Lukhanyo Am have all been nominated for the coveted Players&#8217; Player of the Year</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/239554612_1248269742312772_619598028172862828_n.png","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"the-brightrock-players-choice-awards-2021-nominees","content":"\n<p><strong><em>Siya Kolisi, Damian de Allende, Cheslin Kolbe, Franco Mostert, Eben Etzebeth and Lukhanyo Am have all been nominated for the coveted Players&#8217; Player of the Year</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BrightRock Players Choice Awards, in partnership with MyPlayers, honour and recognise the commitment, determination and talent of South African rugby players.

It’s an agreement where the insurance company promises to pay out a sum of money to the insured person if a specific event happens. In return, the person pays a regular premium – usually, monthly. If the person doesn’t pay their premiums, then the insurance company won’t be able to pay out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Short-term insurance protects your belongings, like your house and car</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people know about short-term insurance, where you insure your valuable belongings such as your car or home. If the insured item is stolen or damaged, your insurer will pay you money to help you cover the cost of replacing or repairing it. Short-term insurance is usually renewed every year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Long-term insurance protects you and your body</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-term insurance protects something even more valuable than your belongings. It covers your life or your ability to earn an income. Long-term insurance policies include policies like funeral cover, life insurance, disability cover and income protection. These policies are taken out for a much longer period, usually at least five years but often for as long as 20 or 30 years, or more. Most long-term insurance policies only come to an end when you retire or when you die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Long-term insurance safeguards you and your family from the financial uncertainty that comes with life-changing events in life, such as serious illness, disability or death</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you become seriously sick or injured and you can’t work anymore because of it, you can claim against your disability or income protection cover. The money you get paid out will help you afford your living expenses. Depending on what cover you have, you might receive a cash lump-sum or a monthly income payment from your insurance company. If you die, the insurance will pay out to the people that you chose to receive the money. These people are called your nominated beneficiaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insurance companies must be properly registered and licensed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both short-term and long-term insurance companies must be registered with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA). You can check whether an insurance company is registered by going to <a href=\"http://www.fsca.co.za\">www.fsca.co.za</a> for this information. They must comply with strict laws, including the Short-term Insurance Act for short-term insurers and the Long-term Insurance Act for long-term insurance. There are also specific Policyholder Protection Rules that aim to protect you as a policyholder. What’s more, most insurance companies subscribe to Ombudsman schemes. An Ombudsman is an independent official who helps the public by investigating their complaints against companies – in this case, insurance companies.</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","just-for-you"],"tags":["brightrock","consumer-education","lets-get-smart-about-life-insurance"],"relatedPosts":["just-for-you-do-you-need-life-insurance","just-for-you-what-is-life-insurance-and-how-does-it-work","budgeting-for-the-future-how-life-insurance-policies-and-savings-plans-work-hand-in-hand","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes"],"searchString":"short term long term insurance – what’s difference brightrock promise ’s agreement where company promises pay out sum money insured person specific event happens what insurance return pays regular premium usually monthly doesn’t their premiums then won’t able out protects your belongings like house car most people know about insurance insure valuable belongings such home item stolen damaged insurer will help cover cost replacing repairing usually renewed every year body something even more than belongings covers life ability earn income policies include funeral cover disability income protection these are taken much longer period least five years often long 20 30 years more only come end when retire die safeguards family from financial uncertainty that comes with life changing events life serious illness death become seriously sick injured can’t work anymore because can claim against protection cover get paid afford living expenses depending have might receive cash lump sum monthly payment company die chose money called nominated beneficiaries companies must properly registered licensed both sector conduct authority (fsca) check whether by going wwwfscacoza this information they comply strict laws including act insurers insurance there also policyholder rules aim protect policyholder more subscribe ombudsman schemes independent official who helps public investigating complaints case companies content staging just consumer education lets get smart about life insurance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7273,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7407,"date":"17 Aug, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Are straightforward claims too complicated?","excerpt":"<p>BrightRock occasionally come across a claim where we believe the terms of a pay-out should be straightforward, only to discover that this is not the usual industry view. </p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Claim-Form.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"are-straightforward-claims-too-complicated","content":"\n<p>Every now and then we, at BrightRock, come across a claim where we think the conditions of a pay-out should be quite straightfor ward and simple, only to find that this is not the general industry view. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, is one recent example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clinical definition for cancer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our 42-year-old client, John, was diagnosed with stage four oesophageal cancer.The cancer was very advanced. BrightRock paid him out a total of R41 million for permanent disability and additional expenses, once we had receivedthe paperwork confirming his diagnosis.With some of this money, John was able to seek treatment options overseas, which were unsuccessful. The money also ensured that he and his family were able to live comfortably in his last few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the face of it, this was a very straightfor ward claim, as the diagnosis was clear. However, upon investigation we found that some insurers do not have a clinical definition for stage four cancer under permanent disability, and that only three out of seven insurers would have paid him out the way that we did. The other four would not have paid him anything at all, due to onerous claims criteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some ofthe reasons why John&#8217;s claim would not have qualified for payment with some insurers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insurer one</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first insurer, a pay-out would need to be based on cancer being the cause of a loss of function, and the ability of the person to do the normal activities of daily living. Insurer one stated that a client had to show a permanent ECOG status of three or four. ECOG is defined as, &#8220;A scale used to assess how a patient&#8217;s disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An ECOG status of three, which would result in only a 50% pay-out should the conditions be met, stipulates that 50% of the insured&#8217;s time must be spent in a bed or chair, where he or she was capable of only limited self-care. An ECOG status of four requires the patient to be totally confined to a bed or chair. John&#8217;s quality of life would, therefore, have to be incredibly poor to qualify, and had he got to that stage, he would in all likelihoodhave stopped working some time before a payment could be made. He would not have met the criteria for ECOG status three or four when he was diagnosed, and so he would have received no pay-out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insurer two</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second insurer bases a cancer pay-out on what cancer does to the body, in this case, &#8220;documented end-organ dysfunction or damage &#8220;.To receive a 50% pay-out under this section, the insured must have lost weight to such an extent that their BMI should be less than 16. With a BMI of 32 on the inception of his policy, and a height of 1.8 metres, John would have to be very ill for some time, before he could qualify for a payment, if ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insurer three</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third insurer has a section for terminal cancer in its policies but do also include pay-outs based on how the cancer affects the body. For the terminal definition, however,the insured&#8217;s life expectancy should be no longer than 12 months. However,there is also a 90-day waiting period for the pay-out of all terminal cancer diagnoses. This means that, to claim, John would have to be sick enough to only live three to twelve months, but not so sick that he would die within the first three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The prupose of life insurance </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, a permanent disability claim for a straightforward stage four cancer diagnosis can still result in a complicated claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of life insurance is to assist people in their time of need. Our investigation of this claim suggests that our industr y still has far to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>T<em>his article first appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/publication/pdf_254_fanewsaug2021\">page 90 of the FAnews August 2021 magazine</a>&nbsp;a<em>nd is&nbsp;attributed to Schalk Malan, BrightRock&nbsp;CEO</em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","claims","fanews","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"are straightforward claims too complicated brightrock occasionally come across claim where believe terms pay out should straightforward only discover that this usual industry view every now then brightrock think conditions quite straightfor ward simple find general below one recent example clinical definition cancer our 42 year old client john diagnosed with stage four oesophageal cancer very advanced paid him out total r41 million permanent disability additional expenses once had receivedthe paperwork confirming his diagnosiswith some money john able seek treatment options overseas which were unsuccessful money also ensured he family live comfortably last few months face claim diagnosis clear however upon investigation found insurers have under disability three seven would way did other anything all due onerous criteria here ofthe reasons why john&#8217;s qualified payment insurers insurer first insurer need based being cause loss function ability person normal activities daily living stated client show ecog status four defined &#8220; scale used assess how patient&#8217;s disease progressing affects living abilities patient determine appropriate prognosis three result 50% met stipulates insured&#8217;s time must spent bed chair she capable limited self care requires patient totally confined chair quality life would therefore incredibly poor qualify got stage all likelihoodhave stopped working before could made met criteria when diagnosed received pay out two second bases what does body case &#8220;documented end organ dysfunction damage &#8220; receive section insured lost weight such extent their bmi less than 16 32 inception policy height 18 metres ill time qualify payment ever third section terminal its policies include pay outs body definition however expectancy longer 12 howeverthere 90 day waiting period diagnoses means that sick enough twelve months die within prupose insurance can still complicated claim purpose assist people need suggests industr y far go t article appeared &nbsp; page 90 fanews august 2021 magazine &nbsp; nd &nbsp;attributed schalk malan brightrock&nbsp;ceo content staging news schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text","image"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All","All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":17017,"pull_quote":"\"For every real-life story of loss, there’s a movie to show the sufferer that they are not alone.\"","type":["expert"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"16/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7433,"date":"13 Aug, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Closing the trauma gap in critical illness cover","excerpt":"<p>In 2015, BrightRock introduced the patented Trauma IQ assessment as a world-first to address the additional costs incurred as a result of accidents that did not meet traditional critical illness criteria.</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Critical-Ilness.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"closing-the-trauma-gap-in-critical-illness-cover","content":"\n<p>BrightRock launched the patented Trauma IQ assessment as a world-first in 2015 to cater for those additional expenses that arose from accidental injuries, yet do not meet traditional critical illness criteria. In 2020, more than half of BrightRock’s additional expense needs claims on its individual life product were Trauma IQ claims. These claims would not have been covered without Trauma IQ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trauma IQ broadens the scope of additional expense needs cover, or as it&#8217;s known in the market, critical illness cover, to take into account the impact of a trauma event on members’ lives. For group risk schemes, Trauma IQ can also be included with members’ death cover. This gives them cover for injuries that result in unexpected expenditure, even if the scheme hasn’t selected additional expense needs cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trauma IQ considers factors overlooked by traditional assessment criteria</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry claims statistics show that trauma and accidental injury are among the leading causes of life insurance claims in South Africa. Traditional assessment criteria focus on the diagnosis of a member’s condition, or on the specific procedure done to treat their condition. However, even with these criteria, several scenarios still exist where members’ trauma claims don’t qualify for a pay-out, regardless of the number of conditions they cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock’s claims experience and in-depth analysis found that traditional assessment criteria often don’t consider certain factors when it comes to the additional expense needs claims of members who have suffered a traumatic injury. Even though members’ conditions might not meet these traditional claims criteria, they might still have incurred substantial additional expenses, such as hospitalisation, surgery and significant rehabilitation. Trauma IQ caters for these overlooked factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A case study: pay-out for a broken ankle</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, a BrightRock client, aged 45, submitted a claim for Trauma IQ after breaking her ankle while jumping on a trampoline at her child’s birthday party. The break was very bad and she had to spend some time in hospital, undergoing extensive surgery and physiotherapy to make sure that she healed properly. The combination of these factors resulted in a pay-out of 7.5% from her additional expense needs cover, which she would not have qualified for with any other provider. She could use this pay-out to assist with additional expenses that she now had, such as an ehailing service to transport her and her children as she couldn’t drive for some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Evaluating the impact of a trauma event using consistent guidelines</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The patented Trauma IQ assessment looks at nine different factors that affect the impact and severity of a traumatic injury. Each element is assigned a number of points, which are combined to provide an overall Trauma IQ score. The maximum number of points that can be assigned to each factor varies per factor because the impact the factor has on a member’s health and financial needs will vary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The member’s pay-out is calculated based on their Trauma IQ score</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the member’s score for each element has been determined, the Trauma IQ assessment adds together their scores, taking into account any cross-factors. This score maps to a set pay-out percentage based on the overall severity and impact, as determined by the Trauma IQ assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pay-out is calculated as the Trauma IQ pay-out percentage multiplied by the maximum cover amount – that is, the lower of the additional expense needs cover amount or a percentage of death cover amount (whichever the scheme has included), or the maximum Rand amount applicable to the scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A needs-matched approach to group risk</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock’s group risk solution means your group risk scheme’s members get claim certainty and flexible insurance that offers more cover for the same premium. It’s a very different approach, delivering group risk cover that precisely matches members’ needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>T<strong>his article was originally published on EBNet on 13 August 2021 <em>and is attributed to Clyde Parson, BrightRock </em>Chief Innovation Officer. <a href=\"https://www.ebnet.co.za/single-post/closing-the-trauma-gap-in-critical-illness-cover\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["clyde-parsons","critical-illness-cover","ebnet","trauma-iq"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"closing trauma gap critical illness cover brightrock 2015 introduced patented iq assessment world first address additional costs incurred result accidents that did meet traditional criteria launched 2015 cater those expenses arose from accidental injuries yet 2020 more than half brightrock’s expense needs claims its individual life product were claims these would have been covered without iq broadens scope cover &#8217;s known market take into account impact event members’ lives group risk schemes can also included with death cover this gives them injuries unexpected expenditure even scheme hasn’t selected considers factors overlooked by criteria industry statistics show injury are among leading causes insurance south africa focus diagnosis member’s condition specific procedure done treat their condition however criteria several scenarios still exist where don’t qualify pay out regardless number conditions they experience depth analysis found often consider certain when comes members who suffered traumatic injury though might substantial expenses such hospitalisation surgery significant rehabilitation caters factors case study: pay out broken ankle client aged 45 submitted claim after breaking her while jumping trampoline child’s birthday party break very bad she had spend some time hospital undergoing extensive physiotherapy make sure healed properly combination resulted 75% which qualified any other provider could use assist now had ehailing service transport children couldn’t drive time evaluating using consistent guidelines looks nine different affect severity each element assigned points combined provide overall score maximum points factor varies per because health financial will vary calculated based score once determined adds together scores taking cross factors maps set percentage impact determined assessment multiplied amount – lower (whichever included) rand applicable scheme needs matched approach solution means your scheme’s get certainty flexible offers same premium ’s approach delivering precisely matches needs t his article originally published ebnet 13 august 2021  attributed clyde parson brightrock  chief innovation officer   click here  read original online version content staging news clyde parsons critical illness cover trauma iq"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text","image"],"style":"narrative","tone":["advisory"],"audience":["25 - 34 All","All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":3529,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"16/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7372,"date":"12 Jul, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"E-cigarettes and your life insurance policy","excerpt":"<p>Smokers can pay more than double the premiums of a non-smoker, depending on factors such as age, pre-existing conditions and the structure of your policy.  </p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E-Cigarettes.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"e-cigarettes-and-your-life-insurance-policy","content":"\n<h2 class=\"has-yellow-color has-text-color\"><strong>Why you get charged smoker rates and what you can do about it</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades now, we’ve known that smoking is bad for our health – the research has conclusively shown that smoking increases your risk of suffering from cancer, heart disease, stroke, and lung disease, among many other conditions. This is the reason why smoker rates are higher than non-smoker rates in life insurance. Smokers can pay more than double the premiums that a non-smoker would pay, depending on factors such as age, pre-existing conditions like those mentioned above, and how you’ve structured your policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But did you know regular users of e-cigarettes are also charged smoker rates when it comes to life insurance?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Why do vapers get charged smoker rates?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>E-cigarettes are battery-operated products designed to deliver nicotine, flavour and other chemicals. They turn chemicals, including nicotine, into an aerosol that is inhaled by the user. Most insurers in South Africa, including BrightRock, charge the users of e-cigarettes the same rates that we charge smokers of traditional tobacco products. There are a number of reasons for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, e-cigarettes, such as vapes, contain smaller doses of nicotine, and other harmful substances such as ultrafine particles, flavourants, and heavy metals. While the levels of nicotine are smaller than they are in traditional tobacco products, they still pose some risk to the long-term health of the user. That being said, some e-cigarettes can contain even more nicotine than normal, combustible cigarettes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, as e-cigarettes are still relatively new in the market, not enough research has been done to investigate the health risks that come with using them. However, some of the available research shows that consuming e-cigarettes has been associated with an increased risk of chronic cough, bronchitis, and asthma. E-cigarette smokers are also believed to be more susceptible to respiratory infections and poor cardiovascular health.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What if I’m vaping because I want to quit smoking?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Health Organisation (which has stated unequivocally that e-cigarettes are harmful to your health) says that of the world’s 1.1 billion smokers, 60% want to quit. Many tobacco smokers use e-cigarettes to help them quit. When underwriting clients for life insurance at BrightRock, we ask if they smoke or use any other nicotine products other than cigarettes, such as cigars, pipes, hubbly bubblies, e-cigarettes, or even nicotine gum. If clients have used any of these products within the preceding 12 months before their applications, we’ll charge them smoker rates. This is because smokers – regardless of whether they’re inhaling nicotine from combustible or e-cigarettes – are most likely to relapse within 12 months of quitting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How do I get non-smoker life insurance rates?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re one of the 600 million people in the world wanting to quit smoking right now, then you’ll be happy to hear that changing this habit is not only worth it from a health perspective but also from a life insurance premium perspective. If you haven’t smoked or used nicotine products for 12 months, then you can apply to get non-smoker life insurance rates. Your insurer will ask you to sign a non-smoker declaration and do a cotinine urine test. If the test comes back negative then this could reduce your premium by up to half, which, at a time when everyone’s watching their rands and cents, is definitely worth considering.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What if I have a policy and start smoking or vaping?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The effect on your cover and premiums will depend on your insurer- at BrightRock, you don’t need to let us know if you start smoking or vaping, and your premiums and cover will not be affected, having started smoking after your policy started won’t affect your claim. However, it’s important to know that there are many insurers in the market that do require you to notify them if you start smoking or vaping- if you don’t, they can reduce, or even decline your claim as a result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article was originally published on Cover Magazine on 12 July 2021 <em>and is attributed to Clyde Parson, BrightRock </em>Chief Innovation Officer. <a href=\"https://cover.co.za/e-cigarettes-and-your-life-insurance-policy/\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","clyde-parsons","e-cigarettes","life-insurance"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"e cigarettes your life insurance policy brightrock smokers can pay more than double premiums non smoker depending factors such age pre existing conditions structure policy why get charged smoker rates what about decades now ’ve known that smoking bad our health – research conclusively shown increases risk suffering from cancer heart disease stroke lung among many other conditions this reason are higher non smoker insurance would pay like those mentioned above how ’ve structured policy &nbsp;&nbsp; did know regular users also when comes insurance vapers rates battery operated products designed deliver nicotine flavour chemicals they turn chemicals including into aerosol inhaled by user most insurers south africa brightrock charge same traditional tobacco products there number reasons this firstly e cigarettes vapes contain smaller doses harmful substances ultrafine particles flavourants heavy metals while levels nicotine products still pose some long term being said even normal combustible cigarettes secondly relatively new market enough been done investigate risks come with using them however available shows consuming associated increased chronic cough bronchitis asthma e cigarette believed susceptible respiratory infections poor cardiovascular health ’m vaping because want quit smoking world organisation (which stated unequivocally health) says world’s 11 billion smokers 60% quit use help them underwriting clients ask smoke any cigarettes cigars pipes hubbly bubblies gum have used these within preceding 12 months before their applications ’ll rates regardless whether they’re inhaling likely relapse quitting &nbsp; ’re one 600 million people wanting right then ’ll happy hear changing habit only worth perspective premium perspective haven’t smoked months apply insurer will sign declaration cotinine urine test test back negative could reduce half which time everyone’s watching rands cents definitely considering &nbsp; start vaping effect cover depend insurer don’t need let us vaping affected having started after won’t affect claim ’s important market require notify vaping don’t reduce decline claim result article originally published magazine july 2021  attributed clyde parson chief innovation officer   click here  read original online version content staging news clyde parsons life insurance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":13755,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7348,"date":"5 Jul, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Life insurance and your savings plan","excerpt":"<p>When you think of your savings plan, life insurance is not likely to be the first thing you associate with saving up for what is important to you. </p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Life-Insurance.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"life-insurance-and-your-savings-plan","content":"\n<p>When you think of your savings plan, life insurance is not likely to be the first thing you associate with saving up for what is important to you. Most people see life insurance as a grudge purchase, something that you only benefit from should something happen to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the surface, life insurance doesn’t seem to have much to do with those financial goals you set yourself, such as paying off your bond for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s important to see life insurance, disability and critical illness cover and your savings as important vehicles that work hand in hand, as part of your financial plan for now and the future. Here are three things to bear in mind when balancing what you spend on insurance versus what how much you set aside for savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Structure your cover efficiently so you can have more left over for savings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should ensure that you structure your life insurance policy so you’re managing your premiums as efficiently as possible, paying as little as you can for adequate life cover so you have additional amounts available to supplement your savings. Getting needs-matched cover is key and it’s vital that you term your life insurance and disability cover appropriately so that you are not overpaying for a period of time that you don’t need that cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important aspect to bear in mind is to make sure that your life insurance policy covers you appropriately and that you’re paying affordable premiums now and in the future so that you can free up money to save for your children’s education, for example. Structuring sustainable life insurance premiums is really important so that you keep the cover that you need in place, instead of being forced to reduce or cancel it in a few years’ time if it becomes unaffordable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to set up regular sessions with your financial advisor to reassess your financial portfolio and make changes if necessary. For example, perhaps you have taken out some life insurance to pay off your bond in case you become disabled or pass away. You recently came into an inheritance, however, and have used this money to pay off your bond. Because you no longer need this cover for your bond, it is a good idea to move that cover to an area in your policy where you are possibly underinsured, or to move that amount into a savings vehicle like your retirement policies. You should be continually rebalancing your cover to make sure your levels of cover for different needs are appropriate. This will help in keeping all aspects of your financial plan relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know that a critical illness or disability can drain your savings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical illness has an important link to savings. For example, you could become disabled in a car crash and need to make multiple changes to your living situation, such as ramps and modifications to your bathroom and kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have cover in place for this eventuality, the money will need to come from somewhere and unfortunately that will mean digging into savings like retirement funds. A small emergency fund will not be enough to pay for the significant additional expenses that could arise from a serious illness or injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, then, even though your life insurance cover and your savings are separate aspects of your financial plan, it’s important that you see them as interrelated. They also need regular evaluation, especially when it comes to cover, so you can make sure that your policies are always efficiently structured and maintain affordability into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to get the best out of your cover so that you can set money aside for what you want and need to save for.

As these figures show, the life insurance sector was not left unscathed by the pandemic. The notable increases in claim pay-outs reflect the economic and social realities we face.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Industry challenges</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While the hike in numbers is unsettling, they also show that the life insurance industry is financially solid and able to honour its commitment to policyholders. Its assets of R333.5 billion are more than double the capital required by the Solvency Capital Requirements (SCR) legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With claim numbers increasing, as well as a decrease in the number of individual life policies being taken out and rising policy lapses, our industry does face challenges. While 9.6 million new individual recurring premium risk policies were bought in 2019, only 8.9 million new policies were taken out last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, 10.2 million policies lapsed in 2020, an increase of 1.4 million when compared to 2019 figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our economy’s recovery predicted to be slow, it is likely that more people will look to cut back on their monthly expenses, either by relinquishing policies or simply not taking out cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the quarterly unemployment statistics released on 1 June 2021 by Stats SA, unemployment rates rose by 0.6% to 43.2% in the first quarter of 2021. Yet, as the pandemic has illustrated, the life insurance sector has a critical role to play in protecting clients during times of economic hardship.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Ensuring the continued buoyancy of the insurance industry</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The responsibility for ensuring the continued buoyancy of the insurance industry in these circumstances lies firmly at the feet of those of us who are within the sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are three things I believe we should work on:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It’s vital that we make long-term insurance more accessible to more people. This means restructuring life policies to help people better understand what their cover is for. It also means cutting out unnecessary waste, to ensure people pay only for what they need. For example, we adopt a needs-matched approach to insurance, meaning that our cover and premiums are designed to meet different people’s specific needs and to change as their circumstances change. A thirty-something business owner with a partner and two children does not need the same type of cover as a single sixty-something manager nearing retirement. By structuring people’s cover to meet their specific needs, we are able to price cover more efficiently, delivering around 40% more cover per premium rand.</li><li>We also need to work harder at demystifying our products for more South Africans, and clearly communicate the benefits that long-term insurance can bring to families and individuals. One of the lessons from this pandemic should be the importance of long-term policies, as these make provision for times of financial hardship, such as a debilitating illness or the death of a breadwinner. Financial advisers are key in conveying the value of long-term insurance and helping clients understand the link between their cover and their financial needs, without fearmongering.</li><li>Allowances should also be made for people who are facing financial hardships. According to the ASISA report, life insurers granted more than R1 billion in relief measures to policyholders through three-to-six-month premium holidays and other premium relief options between March and July 2020. However, with the economic recovery expected to remain slow and South Africa now firmly in its third wave of COVID-19 infections, insurers may need to remain responsive and on standby to offer clients further flexibility and relief if needed.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>In conclusion</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The insurance industry is currently in a solid position, and we need to ensure that it stays that way by maintaining a strong focus on meeting consumers’ needs – particularly, given the ongoing financial strain caused by the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allowing for policies that take into consideration the unique situations of individual policyholders and empowering financial advisers to create efficient, appropriate solutions for their clients will go a long way towards sustaining the sector in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published on BusinessBrief on 30 June 2021 <em>and is&nbsp;<em>attributed to Schalk Malan, BrightRock&nbsp;</em>CEO</em>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbrief.co.za/2021/06/30/the-life-insurance-industry-in-a-covid-19-era-where-to-now/\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","businessbrief","covid-19","life-insurance","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":" life insurance industry covid 19 era: where now brightrock impact recently highlighted when asisa released their 2020 statistics sector association savings investment south africa (asisa) reported that african insurers paid out claims benefit payments worth r5227 billion last year representing significant increase r317 compared 2019 number death previous year rose by nearly 116774;

Small business owners need to insure their businesses against those rainy days where disaster strikes. And, if the last year has taught us anything, it’s that rainy days may come more frequently than we’d like, and they usually come when we least expect it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insuring a business’ physical assets is key, but what self-employed individuals often forget to cover is their most important asset of all – themselves. As good financial planners like you know, life insurance is a critical element that entrepreneurs need to bear in mind when considering the greatest risks to their income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Three elements of long-term insurance:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contingent liability insurance for major debts </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often,business owners have to sign surety on behalf of their business, which can impact their estate in the event of their death. Contingent liability insurance ensures that in the event of the death of the business owner, creditors cannot claim for business debts from their estate, so the business owner’s dependants are left well cared for. This type of insurance also covers the permanent disability of the business owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Life insurance for buy and sell agreements </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will ensure that co-owners of the business can continue to operate with as little disruption as possible in the event of the death of one of the business owners. It also ensures that the estate of the deceased business owner receives fair value for his or her business interest, as well as the settlement of his or her loan account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key-person insurance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The business takes out an insurance policy to compensate it for operational losses that would arise from the death, permanent disability, or extended incapacity of an important member of the business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the benefits of long-term insurance are clear, the affordability of this cover can be a stumbling block for many entrepreneurs. This is particularly true if the cover is structured in the same way as personal life insurance policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With many business insurance policies consisting of a single capitalised block of cover for all needs, this cover structure is priced for the maximum term. It is therefore not necessarily in the best interest of the small business owner as these needs almost always exist for a particular term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that very often businesses are being overcharged for cover that they know they won’t need later on. Another problem is that some needs may even decrease over time. For example, contingent liability cover, and traditionally structured policies might have cover amounts that are appropriate at the outset, but after a while deviate from how the underlying need is behaving over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have decided to follow a more flexible approach to business insurance, where we give entrepreneurs cover that is appropriate to the need that they’re trying to protect. This ensures that the premiums they pay allow small business owners to fully cover their specific needs, as well as invest more funds in their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that you as an adviser can tailor your client’s cover, at the beginning as well as overtime, to match the profile of their needs. One of the ways that we at BrightRock do this is by making allowances for the expansion of the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event where the company’s growth exceeds expectations, and the entrepreneur wants to increase his/her cover, BrightRock policyholders automatically have access to extra cover buy-up, to access more cover later on, without medical underwriting. Another example is through providing certainty to business owners, for example, advisers can structure cover that increases over time, while the premiums for this cover don’t increase but remain constant and predictable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now more than ever, self-employed individuals need to see the value that long-term insurance can bring them. This value comes in the form of sustainable cover with appropriately priced premiums that consider the various stages of an entrepreneur’s business and the relevance of their cover over time. What makes BrightRock’s cover more efficient is that the duration and behaviour of the cover can be matched exactly to that of the underlying need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>T<em>his article first appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fia.org.za/Publication/Issues/quarter2/index.html#p=60\">page 60 of the FIA Insights Quarter 2 of 2021&nbsp;</a>published in June 2021 and is attributed to Sean Hanlon, BrightRock Executive</em>&nbsp;Director</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","fia-insights","financial-advice","sean-hanlon"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"insurance self employed brightrock might tempting sme owners neglect focusing insurance environment governed by uncertainty costs risks are well managed south africa known country entrepreneurial individuals many more have turned self employment recently covid 19 put economy under pressure small business need insure their businesses against those rainy days where disaster strikes last year taught us anything ’s that may come frequently than ’d like they usually when least expect insuring business’ physical assets key what individuals often forget cover most important asset all – themselves good financial planners like know life critical element entrepreneurs bear mind considering greatest income three elements long term insurance: contingent liability major debts oftenbusiness sign surety behalf business which can impact estate event death ensures death owner creditors cannot claim from estate owner’s dependants left cared this type also covers permanent disability owner buy sell agreements will ensure co owners continue operate with little disruption possible one owners deceased owner receives fair value his her interest settlement loan account key person takes out policy compensate operational losses would arise death disability extended incapacity member business &nbsp; while benefits clear affordability stumbling block entrepreneurs particularly true structured same way personal policies policies consisting single capitalised needs structure priced maximum term therefore necessarily best interest these needs almost always exist particular means very being overcharged know won’t later another problem some even decrease over time example cover traditionally amounts appropriate outset after deviate how underlying behaving decided follow flexible approach give they’re trying protect premiums pay allow fully specific invest funds business adviser tailor your client’s beginning overtime match profile needs ways making allowances expansion company’s growth exceeds expectations entrepreneur wants increase his/her policyholders automatically access extra buy without medical underwriting example through providing certainty owners advisers increases time don’t remain constant predictable now ever see bring them comes form sustainable appropriately consider various stages entrepreneur’s relevance makes brightrock’s efficient duration behaviour matched exactly need t article first appeared &nbsp; page 60 fia insights quarter 2 2021&nbsp; published june 2021 attributed sean hanlon executive &nbsp;director content staging news fia insights financial advice sean hanlon"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":5625,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7315,"date":"29 Jun, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"The ins and outs of Group Risk insurance","excerpt":"<p>Group risk cover is a good vehicle to help protect your employees against the possibility of something happening to them where their ability to earn a living is compromised,</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Group-RIsk.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"the-ins-and-outs-of-group-risk-insurance","content":"\n<p>South African companies and their employees pay an estimated R22 billion annually on group risk products. Group risk cover is a good vehicle to help protect your employees against the possibility of something happening to them where their ability to earn a living is compromised, which has become even more important in the current circumstances of the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some key points to note if you are considering taking out group risk cover for your employees, or if you want to make sure that they are getting the best value possible out of the premiums they (or the company) are paying.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong> How does group risk cover work?</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With group risk cover, an employer will typically put together a package of death cover, funeral cover, disability cover and/or critical illness cover for their employees. Then, if an employee is temporarily or permanently disabled or suffers from a critical illness, he or she will be paid out, either as a lump sum or as a monthly instalment. In the event of their death, the employee’s estate or beneficiaries will be paid out. You can also get group risk cover that’s bought by the company’s pension or provident fund, which could pay out on permanent disability or death. Here, the group risk cover would be paid out together with any retirement funding from the fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>What kind of cover is the best kind of group risk cover to have?</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For permanent disability, it would be ideal to have cover that protects the future pay cheques that an employee would expect to earn if he or she weren’t disabled. This means that the lump-sum cover amount would change all the time as the employee earns each pay cheque, and has less to protect. Similarly, for death cover, this type of structure would be ideal, but you do also need an amount of funeral cover to pay for those deathbed expenses. Temporary disability cover is also important to help pay the employee a salary if he or she is ill or injured and not working but is expected to recover. Lastly, critical illness cover is also a good idea but is often covered by an employee’s personal insurance policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How would I explain to younger people in my company, who may generally be in good health, the need for group risk cover?</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, it’s not only ill health that could cause a person to become disabled, or result in their death. A tragic accident could also be the cause of either of these, and being young and healthy doesn’t mean that something like this can’t happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, group disability cover is probably even more important for someone who is young because the younger you are when you become disabled, the more devastating its financial impact can be. This is because there are so many more pay cheques that they would have expected to earn over their working life and so many more now that they won’t get to support themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, when looking at death cover, although a young person might not have dependants yet, there might be some debt that could be paid off by insurance cover. Also, everyone, no matter what age, will have deathbed expenses such as the cost of a funeral, and these can be catered for with some group risk cover, because youngsters are unlikely to have other cover for this purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How much group risk cover is enough?</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees of all ages need to understand if their group risk cover is enough to cover their needs. For example, a group risk death cover amount might be five times an employee’s annual salary, which sounds like a massive amount of money. However, if you consider that a 25-year old has 40 working years ahead of them (in other words, 40 years of salaries to protect), is a pay-out that will cover an eighth of that enough? If it isn’t, then the employee really needs to seek the advice of a financial adviser to fill in the gap between what their group risk cover provides, and what they really need. Although the financial situation is different, a 60-year old would also have to consider whether five times their annual salary is enough or too much. They’re on the other side of the spectrum, and might even want to consider reducing or cancelling existing personal cover because they’re over-insured.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong> If something happens to an employee, what kind of pay-outs can they expect?</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This will depend on what cover the company has put in place. In terms of the group risk cover that’s structured, members generally have very little say as to what gets put in place. Some progressive insurers like BrightRock have developed cover that includes claim-stage choice for the member or the beneficiary (in the case of the member’s death). This means that even if the scheme has put a lump sum permanent disability benefit in place, for example, the member can change this at claim stage to rather pay out a recurring monthly amount. This type of flexibility gives the employee or the people who receive the death payment, the flexibility to take the claim as a pay-out that suits their needs at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong> What happens to an employee’s group risk cover if he or she leaves the company?</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some schemes provide a conversion option, which means that, without medical underwriting, the employee can transfer their group risk cover to an individual life insurance policy. The cost will be different, and the employee will probably have to pay for it themselves, but if they have a health condition that means that they might not be able to access underwritten life cover ordinarily, this may be a great option for them to make sure that they retain cover, and potentially supplement cover that they already have in their personal capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How do I go about getting risk cover for my company?</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The best thing to do is to talk to a financial adviser who can source the most appropriate cover for the group at the best price. These financial advisers are often specialists in the field of group risk insurance and would have contracts with insurance companies that provide group risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published on FANews on 29 June 2021 <em>and is&nbsp;<em>attributed to Schalk Malan, BrightRock&nbsp;</em>CEO</em>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/article/employee-benefits/3/general/1221/the-ins-and-outs-of-group-risk-insurance/32256\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","fanews","group-risk","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":" ins outs group risk insurance brightrock cover good vehicle help protect your employees against possibility something happening them where their ability earn living compromised south african companies pay estimated r22 billion annually products which become even more important current circumstances pandemic here are some key points note considering taking out employees want make sure that they getting best value possible premiums ( company) paying how does work with cover employer will typically put together package death funeral disability / critical illness employees then employee temporarily permanently disabled suffers from illness he she paid out either lump sum monthly instalment event death employee’s estate beneficiaries out can also get that’s bought by company’s pension provident fund could permanent death here would any retirement funding fund what kind have disability ideal have protects future cheques expect weren’t disabled this means lump sum amount change all time earns each cheque less protect similarly type structure ideal need those deathbed expenses temporary salary ill injured working expected recover lastly idea often covered personal policy explain younger people company who may generally health cover firstly ’s only health cause person disabled result tragic accident these being young healthy doesn’t mean like can’t happen secondly probably someone because when devastating its financial impact there many over life now won’t support themselves looking although might dependants yet debt cover also everyone matter age expenses such cost funeral these catered youngsters unlikely other purpose much enough ages understand enough needs example five times annual salary sounds massive money however consider 25 year old 40 years ahead ( words salaries protect) pay out eighth isn’t then really needs seek advice adviser fill gap between provides need situation different 60 year whether too much they’re side spectrum reducing cancelling existing over insured happens employee pay outs expect depend company place terms structured members very little say gets progressive insurers developed includes claim stage choice member beneficiary case member’s death) scheme benefit place claim stage rather recurring amount flexibility gives receive payment take suits time leaves company schemes provide conversion option that without medical underwriting transfer individual themselves condition able access underwritten ordinarily great option retain potentially supplement already capacity go about thing talk source most appropriate price advisers specialists field contracts risk article originally published fanews 29 june 2021 &nbsp; attributed schalk malan brightrock&nbsp; ceo &nbsp; click here&nbsp; read original online version content staging news group risk schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text","image"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All","All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":11020,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"16/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22051,"date":"29 Jun, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Financial planning 101 for young adults","excerpt":"<p>Debt can be healthy and unhealthy.

It is terribly morbid to think like this, but it has kept things in perspective.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clyde Parsons, BrightRock’s Actuarial Executive, advises that “Debt can be healthy and unhealthy. Healthy debt is the sort of debt that adds value to your life and is often asset-based, such as a student loan or a car. Unhealthy debt is mostly credit-based and consists of wants and not necessities such as branded gear, technology and thoughtless spending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But debt is still debt and keeps you from saving for your future or having the money available to you to invest in financial products such as life insurance cover.” Parsons offers Makotle and her peers a few practical day–to-day living tips on how to manage their money as young people starting out in the workplace:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you’re going to buy a car, save for it –</strong>&nbsp;Even if it is small percentage of the cost of the car, put down a deposit. It will bring your monthly repayments down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insurance is your friend –</strong>&nbsp;If you get into an accident and your car is insured, all you need to pay is a minimum excess. It’s amazing what sort of shift occurs in how you drive and treat your car if you think of car insurance as medical aid for your car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A big nest isn’t always the best –&nbsp;</strong>Be reasonable with the space you choose for yourself. Make sure it’s a fit. If you choose a space that’s too big, you will pay for the excess space, both in terms of rent and in terms of how much money you spend on filling the space with things you don’t need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be student loan savvy –</strong>&nbsp;If you’re studying, a student loan is a great help. If you’re paying it back monthly, the interest rate is worked into what you pay back. If you pay it all back when you get a bonus or some money, you’re still paying what you would have paid over your loan period. Rather have that money go off monthly and save your bonus in a fixed account where it can gather interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find a financial role model –</strong>&nbsp;It sounds weird, but if you have a career role model, why can’t you have a financial one? Choose someone who will inspire you to make smart choices, or just pick your friends carefully. Dan Ariely writes in Predictably Irrational that your circle of influence will determine your behaviour and attitude. Who you spend time with shapes who you become. If all else fails, make a career in the financial sector, it will shock the socks off you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can’t avoid tax –&nbsp;</strong>It will happen to you. Save for it, because it’s always a surprise. I’d also suggest finding someone to do your tax return for you or with you so that you get it right the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In the end it comes down to want versus need; will what I want now take away from what I need when I’m a 75 year old? I don’t want to be living on two-minute noodles and lentils in my last years. I got over that when I was a student. I wouldn’t want that for my parents when they retire – so why live like I don’t care about my future needs?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article was originally published on IOL Personal Finance on 29 June 2021 <em>and is attributed to Clyde Parson, BrightRock Actuarial Executive</em>. <a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/personal-finance/debt/financial-planning-101-for-young-adults-5537dd37-9ee4-409a-b8e8-fba64967a6e8\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","clyde-parsons","iol","personal-finance"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"financial planning 101 young adults brightrock debt can healthy unhealthy sort that adds value your life often asset based such student loan car person who’s recently started working becoming responsible own needs below scenario may reality that’s very close home get right there will some bumpy rides along way until have all figured out biggest lesson start out journey don’t trapped ‘living from pay cheque cheque ’ rather work smart with money asanda makotle (23) her first job this story: major asset like most people income area ’m exposed risk were become sick injured covered emergency plan sell people age haven’t thought far even though now best time take insurance because ’ve got youth side least 40 years go before retirement investing cover which means premiums won’t high they look cover few years’ time add more panic situation begun think how 75 year old would want live two minute noodles forever meal day ability move around stay heart terribly morbid this kept things perspective clyde parsons brightrock’s actuarial executive advises debt unhealthy mostly credit based consists wants necessities branded gear technology thoughtless spending still keeps saving future having money available invest products cover parsons offers peers practical day– day living tips manage their starting workplace: ’re going buy car save – &nbsp;even small percentage cost put down deposit bring monthly repayments down friend &nbsp; into accident car insured need minimum excess ’s amazing what shift occurs drive treat medical aid big nest isn’t always –&nbsp; reasonable space choose yourself make sure fit too big excess space both terms rent much spend filling need savvy studying great help paying back monthly interest rate worked back when bonus money paid over period fixed account where gather interest find role model &nbsp; sounds weird career model why can’t one someone who inspire choices just pick friends carefully dan ariely writes predictably irrational circle influence determine behaviour attitude shapes become else fails sector shock socks avoid tax happen surprise ’d also suggest finding return right end comes versus need; away 75 year old lentils last years student wouldn’t parents retire live care about needs article originally published iol personal finance 29 june 2021  attributed parson executive   click here  read original online version content staging news clyde parsons personal finance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":5404,"pull_quote":null,"type":null,"format":null}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7298,"date":"3 Jun, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"BrightRock founders: Our life insurance is not ‘one size fits all’","excerpt":"<p>BrightRock founders joined the BizNews Power Hour to chat to Alec Hogg about their incredibly successful venture as BrightRock celebrates its 10th birthday. </p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/exco-groep-2_A4-2048x1448-1.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"brightrock-founders-our-life-insurance-is-not-one-size-fits-all","content":"\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.brightrock.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BrightRock</a>&nbsp;pioneered needs-matched life insurance,&nbsp;particularly for individuals in South Africa.

And certainly at some point, you take your 10,000 hours and you apply them in a space that you can call and carve out as your own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Schalk Malan&nbsp;on who convinced two out of the three of them to go off on their own and start BrightRock:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there would be different answers to that question – [it] depends on who you ask. No, I’m kidding. I think that’s one of the beautiful parts of our story is that everybody was at the top of their game where they were. [Those] sitting in this room and also even other people who joined us. And that was a good place to actually start from, because it was a wealth of experience. But there’s also that desire, as Suzanne says, to see – can we do it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also for me, more importantly, it was that we believed fundamentally that the products that were currently sold in the South African life insurance industry had some significant room for improvement. And the beauty about what we were thinking wasn’t necessarily something that I think never was thought about. It was actually so obvious. But technology wasn’t really enabling that. And the way of delivering that in the hands of the advisor and that wasn’t there. And we had many discussions over many years. It actually didn’t come with an ‘aha moment’ – (to answer your question in a long winded way).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what we didn’t realise was [that] what we wanted to achieve would have had to take a complete rethink of the infrastructure, the technology, the way that it’s delivered in the clients hands, the way that it manifests in the client – the end-client, not just the advisor’s hands. I think that just made it such an obvious step – actually, you’ve got to start new, you’ve got to start rethinking every single component. And that’s what we did. Every single aspect of our business was rethought, every single word in the policy document. And I think that’s what really makes the story so absolutely fantastic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sean Hanlon&nbsp;on how BrightRock gets their distribution right in South Africa where there are such big giants who have got such a hold over the distribution channels:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funnily enough, it’s like the eternal debate between actuaries and salespeople; what comes first – is it the product or is it the distribution? And obviously it’s a combination. But, I mean, you are absolutely spot on. If you don’t get out there and tack your colours to a mast and fundamentally get in front of clients, in front of brokers – nothing happens until someone sells something. For us, it was a massive challenge. You speak about our pasts; you know, we really cut our teeth in some fabulous companies in this country, and without that – I certainly could not have done this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the challenge was not just about a fundamentally different approach to protecting a family’s balance sheet, in essence that’s what life insurance is, but it was changing the way people were selling it, as Schalk alluded to. So, that coupled with the challenge of who’s BrightRock… You know, sound like a diamond mine. And will you be here a year from now?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Suzanne Stevens on where the name BrightRock came from:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, we spent quite a bit of time thinking through what we’d be looking for in a name. So we had established the criteria before we could find a name. And there were a couple of things we were looking for. I mean, we wanted it to carry meaning. We felt that something that was in English was probably preferable so that it was the spoken business language of South Africa. And then very importantly, we wanted it to be something that didn’t have to spell if you heard it, [that] it was something that you could find on the Internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were very conscious of finding a name and a brand that worked in a technically online, digitally enabled world. So there were a couple of things, and then, quite frankly, you have to see what’s available. Because part of when you think it through; there are quite a few of your ideas that you think are genius, and then when you go and look [there are] other geniuses that also thought of those names.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Schalk Malan on entering an industry that was concretised:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think looking back ten years, if you just look at our market share now – we’re touching into that 15% in the independent broker market, which I think was hugely disruptive, as you say, in an industry that was quite concretised. You know, it was very solid.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you look at our product, Sean alluded to it, it is a product that tries to achieve a client’s needs – protecting their balance sheet in a fundamentally different way of utilising technology, stripping out waste and getting our clients. I mean, we’ve seen our clients getting the same premium, getting up to double the cover for the same exact need that they then specified from the start – and not just protecting it upfront, but also over time [it is] able to adapt and change. And that has been very disruptive.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And notwithstanding the fact that – as Sean says, the challenge was [that] with a new product (and it’s quite often the case with established markets), you’ve got to then retrain and you’ve got to manage the change in terms of the sales process. And that comes with its challenges. A very revolutionary, disruptive product does bring those challenges, which I think we as a team appreciated from day one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sean Hanlon on BrightRock’s product not being ‘one size fits all’:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at the movements, the one thing we saw 10 years ago – especially after subprime lending and the massive shift in consumerism – is this constant tuning of the way in which people are changing, the way they’re buying and selling. There is a logical movement all around the world to move away from a ‘one size fits all’ from a commoditised space to an individualised space. And if you look at the way in which we traditionally sell life insurance; we do a financial needs analysis on you – which is a theoretical exercise – then we have to match a product to carry that risk off balance sheet – that family’s risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then it’s a ‘one size fits all’. So my bond and the shaping of my bond, the duration of my children – hopefully they don’t stay too long in my house… they all have different shapes and durations. But there was nothing that could actually match those needs. So you reverted back to price; ‘Well, how much can you afford? There’s a chunk of life cover.’ And there was no relevance between the need and the cover. And the efficiency or the lack of efficiency inside those one dimensional structures really was our call to arms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sean Hanlon on how innovative the incumbents are getting:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I don’t think they’ve changed fast enough to be honest. Again; ‘How much can you afford? There’s a chunk of amorphous life cover. You know, what does that mean in a world where people are looking more to – ‘If I want to buy a commodity, I can go online’ you know? But the more sophisticated my portfolio is and this glut of information that I have as a consumer – I’m flighting to advice. So, life assurance is very much product driven. It’s about squeezing advice into a product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our view was to say; ‘Let’s platform your advice through a product’. And that was a fundamentally different shift. We had to fundamentally change the way in which life insurance pros were used in the advice process. We’ve seen competitors try and look like that, but the ability of the product to fracture up and to match each need accurately is still not in place. And we are still the world’s only needs-matched insurer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published on BizNews on 3 June 2021 <em>and is&nbsp;<em>attributed to BrightRock</em></em>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.biznews.com/thought-leaders/2021/06/03/brightrock-insurance\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["10th-anniversary","biznews","brightrock","schalk-malan","sean-hanlon","suzanne-stevens"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"brightrock founders: our life insurance ‘one size fits all’ founders joined biznews power hour chat alec hogg about their incredibly successful venture celebrates its 10th birthday &nbsp;pioneered needs matched insurance &nbsp;particularly individuals south africa company founded by three professionals – all which were employed senior positions discovery left pursue entrepreneurial calling these innovators –&nbsp;

But what about when something happens to the child of the person who has taken out the policy, such as severe illness or mental or physical disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I will be discussing three of the elements that come into play on the topic of cover for children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Three of the elements</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The health of the child at birth</strong> &#8211; Life insurance policies start from the moment of the child’s birth, providing that the parent has had the policy for at least nine months before this event. Should  something happen to the child at birth that requires medical intervention, and meets one of the clinical definitions under criticalmillness cover, including child-specific claim definitions, then there will be cover for the child, for example, for surgery for cleft palate repair or club feet. One example of a child-specific condition would be a short-term NICU admission, with mechanical intervention for at least 48 hours after the child’s birth, which often occurs with premature babies. In this case, an insurer would pay out 75% of the child’s cover amount.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The health of a child in later life</strong> &#8211; The second aspect of this topic is where the child doesn’t present any conditions at birth that could impact their lives, but these occur later. Any parent’s worst nightmare is something happening to their child, and for a few hundred illness and injury events, some insurers can make a pay-out for a child, as well as a parent. For example, in the specific case of a child contracting bacterially confirmed meningococcal meningitis, which is an inflammation of the brain lining, some insurers cover up to 100% under critical illness if there is permanent neurological damage. In addition, the insurers cover any neurological condition that results in a permanent neurological deficit, which would pay out for both the parent, as well as their children, under critical illness.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The health of the parent </strong>&#8211; When considering the care of special needs children, it is not just the health  of the child that needs to be considered – the health of the parent must also be taken into account. For example, in the case of a child who does not present physical or mental disabilities, the costs associated with that child would only need to be covered by their parents’ life insurance policies until he or she was financially independent, i.e. anywhere between 18 to 24 years old, depending on the selections made on the policy. In the case of a child with special needs, however, he or she may require care beyond adulthood, therefore he or she should be covered for the entire period that the parent is earning an active income. On the death, or permanent or temporary disability of the parent, the childcare  costs of the special needs child would be covered under household expenses, for example, on a policy, as the associated expenses would need to be catered for until the parent retires. The parent is also able to lock in claim payments as monthly pay-outs, rather than a lump sum under death cover. Neither the beneficiary nor the guardian of the child, should the parent pass away, can change this, which can give great peace of mind to the parent of a child with special needs that a lump-sum insurance payment won’t be used for its intended purpose. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Each client’s unique needs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another useful feature of some life insurance policies is that you can grow cover for the costs of different needs, at different rates. While a cost like groceries under household needs may grow at an inflation rate, costs incurred for special needs children like medical costs can grow at a rate higher than general consumer inflation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A policy should be crafted to suit each client’s unique needs. This should be a guiding principle when it comes to policies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article first appeared on <a href=\"file:///D:/Downloads/pdf_247_fanewsjune2021.pdf\">page 61 of FANews Magazine</a> published in June 2021 and is attributed to Clyde Parson, BrightRock Actuarial Executive</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br><br><br></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","clyde-parsons","fanews"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"caring special needs children brightrock life insurance policies help policyowners financially prepare unexpected what something happens child person who taken out policy about when policy such severe illness mental physical disability this article will discussing three elements that come into play topic cover children health birth &#8211; start from moment child’s birth providing parent had policy least nine months before event should happen requires medical intervention meets one clinical definitions under criticalmillness cover including child specific claim definitions then there child example surgery cleft palate repair club feet example condition would short term nicu admission with mechanical intervention 48 hours after which often occurs premature babies case insurer pay 75% amount later second aspect where doesn’t present any conditions could impact their lives these occur later parent’s worst nightmare happening few hundred injury events some insurers can make pay out well parent specific case contracting bacterially confirmed meningococcal meningitis inflammation brain lining 100% critical permanent neurological damage addition results deficit both parent children illness considering care just considered – must also account does disabilities costs associated only need covered by parents’ until he she independent e anywhere between 18 24 years old depending selections made policy needs however may require beyond adulthood therefore entire period earning active income death temporary disability childcare household expenses expenses catered retires able lock payments monthly pay outs rather than lump sum death cover neither beneficiary nor guardian pass away change this give great peace mind lump sum payment won’t used its intended purpose each client’s unique another useful feature grow different rates while cost like groceries inflation rate incurred rate higher general consumer inflation crafted suit needs guiding principle comes policies article first appeared   page 61 fanews magazine  published june 2021 attributed clyde parson actuarial executive content staging news clyde parsons"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":22048,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7293,"date":"31 May, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"BrightRock celebrates 10 years in the life insurance business","excerpt":"<p>Needs-matched life insurer, BrightRock, celebrates its tenth anniversary today.

Founded in 2011, BrightRock has stayed true to its roots of living and loving change over the past decade. In true entrepreneurial fashion, the company started around a dining room table and has received recognition from the industry and consumers alike for its approach to changing the way financial services products work to better meet people’s needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From those humble beginnings, BrightRock is an entrepreneurial success story. From a zero-base start-up, the needs-matched life insurer has grown rapidly into a market leader. It is South Africa’s fastest-growing life insurer and the third-largest life insurer in its market segment, having paid out over R2.4 billion in claims and covering 2.8 million lives across the individual risk, group risk and funeral assistance markets.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on the past decade, Schalk Malan, BrightRock CEO, who co-founded the business along with colleagues Sean Hanlon and Suzanne Stevens, says they believe the needs-matched life insurer’s success can be attributed to a few factors: “Firstly, we got the right people together. Each of us has very diverse skill sets and, although we are not afraid to challenge one another, each person is respected for their expertise in his or her chosen field, bringing something unique to the table.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another factor in BrightRock’s success, explains Malan, was not playing on the same playing field as their competitors. They created a playing field with new rules by differentiating what they did in every facet of their business – products, systems and servicing, sales and distribution, and marketing. Malan, a qualified actuary, is the main architect behind the BrightRock product, while Hanlon has spearheaded its distribution strategies, and Stevens its marketing strategies and brand. “For the past 10 years, the ability to see the opportunity inherent in all change by applying our needs-matched approach to everything we do, has allowed BrightRock to create a leading South African financial services business that is challenging and changing the industry,” says Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A central theme in BrightRock’s story is its ‘love change’ philosophy – the belief that all change brings with it the opportunity, and that anyone is capable of learning to embrace change. This belief is supported by behavioural science and the concept of ‘Positive Deviance’. Behavioural scientists posit that there are specific, positive behaviours that set apart the individuals who are able to succeed when faced with similar challenges where their peers tend to fail. This ‘Positive Deviance’ is the capacity for people to adapt to their situation and come up with better solutions and then immediately taking action to implement those solutions. It requires openness, and optimism of behaviour, and the ability to taken proactive steps first rather than thought – in essence, it is a mindset of ‘acting’ one’s way into a new way of thinking, rather than thinking your way into a new way of acting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This adaptable mindset is one that Malan and his co-founders believe has helped BrightRock grow and succeed in South Africa’s complex and competitive life insurance market. In particular, he emphasises the tenacity that is necessary to turn a start-up business into a going concern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When asked what advice I have for entrepreneurs, my answer is simple: Never, ever give up. In the beginning, it is hard because many people doubt you, telling you that you’ve no chance to succeed in taking on the established players in the market. You’re constantly watching the cash flow and new business numbers and need to recruit and motivate people based on a promise of what the business will become. There will be many sleepless nights and anxious early mornings, but it helps to have colleagues you can share the journey with – keep positive, keep making a new plan when there are curve balls, drive through walls, and never give up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, BrightRock is the fastest-growing insurer in its market segment, providing cover that is both relevant and appropriate to each and every individual client. Industry statistics indicate that BrightRock was the only insurer in its sector to grow its new business premium during the lockdown period. In 2020, BrightRock saw a 10,8% increase in new business sales. This is the greatest overall increase in new business relative to other providers in that segment, with the market declining by 16.5% on average over the same period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Malan, BrightRock is poised to continue growing and innovating, to continue finding better ways to meet clients’ financial needs throughout their lives and to continue changing the industry in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We look forward to what the next 10 years will bring,” he concludes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ten memorable milestones for the needs-matched insurer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are just 10 of the many memorable milestones BrightRock has reached over the past 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Launching the world’s first-ever needs-matched life insurance in 2012</strong> – After starting the business in 2011, in April 2012, BrightRock launched its needs-matched life insurance product to Independent Financial Advisers. Schalk Malan received the Cover Excellence Award for product innovation in 2013 as the main architect of BrightRock’s needs-matched product design. BrightRock has featured at industry conferences in Germany, Australia, Singapore, and the USA.</li><li><strong>Helping people navigate change in their lives</strong> – In February 2014, BrightRock launched The Change Exchange, a digital platform that aims to support consumers in making important life decisions. Consumers can use it to share their thoughts and get information and support as they navigate through life&#8217;s major ‘Change Moments’: Starting a family, Tying the knot, Making a home, and landing a job.</li><li><strong>Diversifying our product offering into funeral parlours</strong> – In 2015, BrightRock diversified its oﬀering by providing funeral parlours with a comprehensive solution for their insurance administration, underwriting and compliance needs. Support services included everything from compliant documentation and record-keeping to support for funeral parlours’ clients when they claimed against their funeral cover.</li><li><strong>Exceeding the R100 billion cover mark </strong>– BrightRock’s cover in force exceeded the R100 billion mark in late 2015. This came at a time when the South African insurance industry had remained stagnant, while BrightRock was seeing an 89% increase in year-on-year gross premiums billed. Today BrightRock’s cover in force exceeds R350bn.</li><li><strong>Playing the bounce</strong> – In 2016, BrightRock announced its sponsorship of the DHL Stormers and DHL Western Province. December 2017 marked the inaugural BrightRock Players Choice Awards – the only South African rugby awards for professional rugby players by professional rugby players. And in 2021, BrightRock announced our associate sponsorship of the Vodacom Bulls.</li><li><strong>Expanding horizons with Sanlam</strong> – In September 2017 Sanlam acquired a majority stake in BrightRock, which provided a stronger platform for growth and expansion. Under the agreement, Sanlam and BrightRock continue to function as independent businesses, retaining their own brands, life insurance licences and management teams.</li><li><strong>Changing the group risk market </strong>– In May 2018, BrightRock brought further change to the life insurance industry with the introduction of a group risk product that could provide schemes with up to 40% more cover for the same premium. In contrast to traditional group risk products, BrightRock’s group risk product provided greater certainty and flexibility, now and in the future. It also better suited the demands of a changing workforce.</li><li><strong>Paying out R1 billion in claims</strong> – In July 2019 BrightRock announced that it had reached the R1 billion mark in claims paid, covering more than two million lives across its individual life, life assistance and group risk offerings. At the time, SwissRe placed BrightRock among the top four insurers in South Africa in its market segment, with the majority of lump-sum disability business sold by independent advisers in the large premium market category placed with BrightRock. Today BrightRock has paid out more than R2.4 billion in claims since its inception.</li><li><strong>Enhancing temporary expenses cover</strong> – In October 2019, BrightRock added enhancements to its temporary expenses cover products. These included the addition of new conditions to its list of clinical conditions, increased claims certainty for clients in specific occupations, and claim-stage choice between a lump-sum or a recurring pay-out – a market first.</li><li><strong>Achieving a 14.3% market share during COVID-1</strong>9 – 2020 was a tough year for the nation, and the world at large, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit. While the insurance industry largely remained resilient, fewer risk policies were sold, and there were increased claims and lapse rates. However, BrightRock proved resilient during these testing times and posted positive growth, with a market share of 14.3% (based on annual premium income), and a 10.8% increase in new business sales. This was the greatest overall increase in new business relative to other providers in that segment, with the market declining by 16.5% on average over the same period.</li></ol>\n","categories":["content-staging","press-releases"],"tags":["10th-anniversary","brightrock","schalk-malan","sean-hanlon","suzanne-stevens"],"relatedPosts":["budgeting-for-the-future-how-life-insurance-policies-and-savings-plans-work-hand-in-hand","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes","brightrocks-2021-payout-equal-to-all-claims-paid-in-its-first-7-years-in-business","needs-matched-life-insurer-brightrock-announces-growth-in-2021-despite-a-challenging-time-for-the-life-insurance-industry"],"searchString":"brightrock

However, we will only begin to see the real impact of it in a few years, given that we are more focused on the long term. We cannot yet tell what the future will reveal about life insurance and COVID-19, five, 10 or 20 years down the line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has spurred our industry to rethink many aspects of our business, as we muse over how potential changes will affect our clients, and how we can ensure that they are best protected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The new way of working</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of these unknowns is workplace disabilities, which are a key element of any well-structured life insurance policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary reason for this, of course, is that Working From Home (WFH) has now become more entrenched as a viable option for companies. COVID-19 accelerated South Africa’s adoption of this remote workplace, as in many countries around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Business owners have now realised that presenteeism does not equal productivity, and managers and employees alike have seen many benefits from this new way of working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remote working also comes with its downsides, however, and mental wellbeing is something that has been negatively impacted by the pandemic. Feelings of isolation resulting from not having enough face-to-face human interaction have led to increased episodes of depression, and this may be likely to increase workplace disability claims now, and in the future, if WFH becomes a staple for some companies. While some may thrive in a flexible working world, others may find it alienating and be unable to physically work, because of the extent of their depression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A few elements to consider</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, those who are prone to mental health problems caused by being at the office (think workplace bullying), may well find that being away from a stressful office environment, and perhaps even from toxic individuals at their workplace, helps them to thrive in a working from home situation. So, this could mean that some people who may have usually claimed for workplace disability, based on mental health issues, would not be as likely to claim in a world where a remote workplace is a norm, or at least be rehabilitated far more quickly where the actual source of the stress<br>may, in the past, have been what prevented them going back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to physical disability, there are also a few elements we should consider, such as the duration of a disability claim. For example, in a pre-COVID-19 era, a musculoskeletal injury such as a serious back injury, might have meant that an employee was unable to work for six months, as, among other things, there were too many physical barriers to going to work and within the workplace itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in a scenario where an employee can work from home, he or she may only need four months to recover, as little physical exertion and workplace accommodation is needed. This is good news for companies, as they will be able to better retain human capital, as well as employees who can become productive members of society again far more quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The effects will be interesting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I intimated in my introduction, it will take a few years for us to see any kind of trend in terms of what kind of impact COVID-19 and its cousin, remote working, will have on workplace disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I can say, though, is that it is a rare time in the industry when such a life-changing event is experienced across the globe. The effects will be interesting, whatever the results many show, and may likely even result in a redefinition of the category of workplace disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing will remain constant, though, and that is the commitment the industry has to navigate, to help clients through these changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/publication/pdf_245_fanewsapr2021\">page 82 of the FANews Magazine</a> published in April 2021 and is attributed to Clyde Parson, BrightRock Actuarial Executive</strong></em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","clyde-parsons","fanews"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"covid 19 workplace disability claims brightrock like many industries life insurance been affected by covid 19 however will only begin see real impact few years years given that are more focused long term cannot yet tell what future reveal about covid 19 five 10 20 years down line this spurred our industry rethink aspects business muse over how potential changes affect clients can ensure they best protected new way working one these unknowns disabilities which key element any well structured policy primary reason this course from home (wfh) now become entrenched viable option companies accelerated south africa’s adoption remote workplace countries around world business owners have realised presenteeism does equal productivity managers employees alike seen benefits working also comes with its downsides mental wellbeing something negatively impacted pandemic feelings isolation resulting having enough face face human interaction led increased episodes depression may likely increase now future wfh becomes staple some while thrive flexible world others find alienating unable physically work because extent their depression elements consider other hand those who prone health problems caused being office (think bullying) well away stressful environment perhaps even toxic individuals helps them situation could mean people usually claimed disability based issues would claim world where norm least rehabilitated far quickly actual source stress may past prevented going back when physical there should consider such duration claim example pre covid 19 era musculoskeletal injury serious back injury might meant employee work six months among things were too barriers within itself scenario home he she need four months recover little exertion accommodation needed good news companies able better retain capital productive members society again quickly effects interesting intimated introduction take us kind trend terms cousin working disabilities say though rare time life changing event experienced across globe interesting whatever results show result redefinition category disability thing remain constant commitment navigate help clients through changes article first appeared   page 82 fanews magazine  published april 2021 attributed clyde parson actuarial executive content staging clyde parsons"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious","advisory"],"audience":["25 - 34 All","All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":7079,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":true,"last_reviewed":"16/08/2022","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7214,"date":"16 Apr, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Why must funeral policies be underwritten by an insurer?","excerpt":"<p>According to the latest Long-Term Insurance Ombudsman’s annual report, published in May 2020, the bulk of the complaints received in 2019 related to funeral insurance policies</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Isaac.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"why-must-funeral-policies-be-underwritten-by-an-insurer","content":"\n<p>South Africa’s funeral insurance industry seems to be in the news often for all the wrong reasons. According to the latest Long-Term Insurance Ombudsman’s annual report, published in May 2020, the bulk of the complaints received in 2019 related to funeral insurance policies, with consumers complaining about unpaid claims and poor service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is more, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) regularly warns consumers against funeral insurance providers that are not underwritten by a registered longterm insurer. The truth is, though, that funeral insurance is by far the most popular financial product among South<br>African consumers. Funeral products play a fundamentally important societal role, both culturally and economically. It is therefore of cardinal importance that policyholders should enjoy the peace of mind of knowing their funeral plan is underwritten by a credible, reliable insurance provider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No guarantee without underwriting!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of funeral insurance is to provide cover to help pay for the costs of funeral services, usually provided by a funeral parlour. A funeral policy must be underwritten by a licensed long-term insurer to ensure that the policyholder and their beneficiaries are guaranteed of their benefits being paid to them in the event of a valid claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Insurance Act sets out the characteristics of a life insurance policy underwritten under the funeral class of life insurance business, as set out in Table 1 of Schedule 2 of the Act. Section 5 (1) of the Act prohibits any unlicensed person from conducting insurance business in South Africa. This means that no funeral policy can be sold unless there is a licensed insurer on-risk for that policy. Any policy that is not underwritten by a licensed insurer is not legitimate in terms of the Act, putting consumers at risk of not getting their policy benefits should they claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The customer’s perspective</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What factors should your clients consider before taking out funeral insurance? The FSCA regularly advises end-consumers to check that the entity they are conducting business with, whether this is a brokerage, funeral parlour or an individual, is registered with the Authority to provide financial advisory and intermediary services. They should also check which category of advice the agent or representative they are dealing with is authorised to provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers can verify whether or not an institution or person is authorised to render financial services by checking the FSCA website (www.fsca.co.za) or calling them on 080020 37 22. The law also states that every policy document must include the name of the licensed insurer who is underwriting the policy. Once the policy document is received, consumers can check for the insurer’s details and contact the insurer to verify that the policy in question is indeed underwritten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Breaking the law</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are serious repercussions for buying funeral insurance from an unregistered or unauthorised financial services provider (FSP). Insurance is about risk. When consumers buy funeral insurance from a registered FSP, the benefits in their policies are guaranteed as long as they have fulfilled all their policy obligations, such as paying their monthly premiums.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if a consumer buys funeral insurance from an unauthorised FSP, then the policyholder and beneficiaries will not be guaranteed payment of benefits in the event of a claim. Furthermore, consumers who purchase funeral insurance from an unregistered FSP may not have easy recourse<br>to the FCSA or Long-Term Insurance Ombudsman should they experience problems with the underwriter or broker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are in the business of selling funeral products or are looking to buy a funeral policy, be sure to do your research to make sure that both the product provider and sales agent you are dealing with are registered, the policy appropriately written. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/magazines/pdf/pdf_246_fanewsfuneral2021.pdf\">page 28 of the FANews Funeral Insurance Digital Magazine</a> published on 16 April 2021 and is attributed to Isaac Mudau, BrightRock Executive: Product Operations. </strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","fanews","funeral-assistance"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"why must funeral policies underwritten by insurer brightrock according latest long term insurance ombudsman’s annual report published may 2020 bulk complaints received 2019 related south africa’s industry seems news often all wrong reasons policies with consumers complaining about unpaid claims poor service what more financial sector conduct authority (fsca) regularly warns against providers that are registered longterm insurer truth though far most popular product among african consumers products play fundamentally important societal role both culturally economically therefore cardinal importance policyholders should enjoy peace mind knowing their plan credible reliable provider guarantee without underwriting!

To begin, the Financial Advisory and Intermediaries Services (FAIS) Act sets minimum standards for the business activities and conduct of authorised financial services providers (FSPs). The Act requires any person or company that provides financial services to register as a FSP and obtain a licence through the FCSA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of licensing is to ensure that applicants are fit and proper for business and that they operate lawfully, in the public’s interest. Only licensed FSPs and their duly appointed representatives can provide advice or intermediary services, known as financial services, under the FAIS Act.<br>Advice includes providing clients with recommendations, guidance or proposals of a financial nature relating to the purchase, variation, replacement or termination of an insurance product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FAIS Act also provides for the conduct and prudential framework for FSPs in line with the financial product categories they distribute. It stipulates that all authorised FSPs must ensure that their key individuals and representatives are, when rendering a financial service, competent to act, and comply with all the fit and proper requirements as well as any other requirements included in the Act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fit and proper requirements</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FAIS Fit and Proper Requirement for FSPs and their representatives establishes a higher level of professionalism and compliance in the industry. FSPs are always expected to be honest and have integrity and be in good standing. FSPs and their representatives are expected to operate in the best interest of their clients, especially when advising on financial products. They should disclose all information about the financial product at the inception stage, during the lifetime of the policy and at the claim stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FAIS also requires FSPs to be financially sound and not to use client premiums to carry out business operations. In other words, clients’ premiums should only be used to insure their clients against claims that may arise on a risk event and not for administration costs or for other operational purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The law for insurers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Insurance Act establishes a legal framework for the prudential regulation and supervision of insurers and insurance groups. It ensures the safety and soundness of insurers, enhances the protection of policyholders and potential policyholders, promotes the broad-based transformation of the insurance sector and contributes to the stability of the financial system in general. This Act also sets out the licensing of insurers and their governance and solvency requirements, so that insurers can pay claims as they arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurers are also regulated under the Long-Term Insurance Act (LTIA), which describes how they should conduct themselves in the market. In particular, under Rule 2A of the Policyholder Protection Rules (PPR), the LTIA sets out specific standards of how funeral products should be structured and administered to ensure fair outcomes for policyholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Penalties for non-compliance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A person who conducts business in South Africa without an insurance licence commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of up to R10 million. The PA may also direct that person to discharge all or any of its insurance obligations and may apply for the liquidation of that person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, in the event of a breach of any of the compliance obligations, ignorance of the law will not be an excuse. For this reason, it is vital that all role players in the industry familiarise themselves with the regulatory requirements and strictly adhere to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/magazines/pdf/pdf_246_fanewsfuneral2021.pdf\" title=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/magazines/pdf/pdf_246_fanewsfuneral2021.pdf\">page 16 of the FANews Funeral Insurance Digital Magazine</a> published on 16 April 2021 and is attributed to Anelang Kakudi, BrightRock Senior Manager: Market Conduct and Regulatory Affairs.  </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","fanews","funeral-assistance"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"what law says about selling funeral insurance brightrock south africa features highly regulated financial services industry with specific rules that apply insurers who provide cover agents representatives sell this this consumers twin peaks regulatory framework makes provision two types oversight market namely market conduct by sector conduct authority (fsca) prudential matters (pa) africa’s does consist begin advisory intermediaries (fais) act sets minimum standards business activities authorised providers (fsps) requires any person company provides register fsp obtain licence through fcsa purpose licensing ensure applicants are fit proper they operate lawfully public’s interest only licensed fsps their duly appointed can advice intermediary services known under fais act includes providing clients recommendations guidance proposals nature relating purchase variation replacement termination product also line product categories distribute stipulates all must key individuals are when rendering service competent act comply requirements well other included requirement establishes higher level professionalism compliance industry always expected honest have integrity good standing best interest clients especially advising products should disclose information inception stage during lifetime policy claim stage financially sound use client premiums carry out operations words clients’ used insure against claims may arise risk event administration costs operational purposes legal regulation supervision groups ensures safety soundness insurers enhances protection policyholders potential policyholders promotes broad based transformation contributes stability system general governance solvency requirements pay arise long term (ltia) which describes how themselves market particular rule 2a policyholder (ppr) ltia products structured administered fair outcomes policyholders penalties non compliance conducts without commits offence liable conviction fine r10 million pa direct discharge its obligations liquidation person remember breach obligations ignorance will excuse reason vital role players industry familiarise strictly adhere them article first appeared page 16 fanews digital magazine published april 2021 attributed anelang kakudi senior manager: affairs content staging news funeral assistance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":22048,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7201,"date":"12 Apr, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"In Sanlam&#8217;s shadow or lighting its own spark?

But BrightRock CEO Schalk Malan and his co-founding team believe that their &#8220;needs-matched&#8221; model will become a hit with funders and customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, it will allow consumers to redirect their premiums to new benefits, without buying new cover, if they no longer need the cover they have and it promises to cut frills so that it an offer cover cheaper than the incumbents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Starting out, we didn&#8217;t have our own licence. We rented a life insurance licence from the Lombard Insurance Group,&#8221; Malan said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lombard also saw potential in BrightRock&#8217;s model and gave it the financial backing it needed to get its business off the ground. BrightRock launched in the intermediated, individual risk market in 2012.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lombard was a different kind of investor to what BrightRock, which sold a 53% stake of its business to Sanlam in 2017, would later attract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We needed that venture capital funder where there&#8217;s an appreciation of the trials and challenges of a new business. To have corporate funders at the start, it&#8217;s very difficult for them because they have to be much more prescriptive,&#8221; Malan said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Swallowed or enabled by Sanlam?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just six years into BrightRock&#8217;s existence, Africa&#8217;s biggest life insurer, Sanlam, also saw the potential Lombard spotted. For Sanlam, the strategy was to seek profitable growth opportunities that would allow it to tap into markets it wasn&#8217;t reaching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan said when BrightRock started the conversations about a possible deal with Sanlam, it made it clear that it wouldn&#8217;t compromise on its independence. It wanted to maintain its own brand and separate life insurance from Sanlam&#8217;s. It also wanted to continue running its own distribution channel through the independent broker network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If I look at how the exposure of the BrightRock brand has grown over the last five years, I would argue that the strength of the brand has been one of our biggest achievements,&#8221; said Malan, adding that its numbers show that it&#8217;s not living in Sanlam&#8217;s shadow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said Sanlam encourages this independence to have &#8220;two horses in the race&#8221;. The two companies compete directly with each other and with the rest of the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan said he saw Sanlam as a shareholder investor and not that BrightRock was part of the Sanlam group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan said Sanlam has been &#8220;an enabler&#8221; of its growth, keeping its distance and allowing the BrightRock team to steer the ship as it sees fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve enabled the business from a capital point of view and they played a significant role in maturing the business from a governance point of view,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He reckoned that acquiring a majority stake in BrightRock has proven to be a successful investment for Sanlam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Collectively, we&#8217;ve now ensured that Sanlam is the top new business writer in the broker market. From an investment point of view, it definitely hit the nail on the head,&#8221; said Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Paul Hanratty-led insurer has faced challenges with some of its other recent ventures. It had to <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/fin24/companies/financial-services/interview-sanlam-prepared-for-at-least-two-more-covid-19-waves-ceo-20210315\" title=\"https://www.news24.com/fin24/companies/financial-services/interview-sanlam-prepared-for-at-least-two-more-covid-19-waves-ceo-20210315\">write down the value of its Moroccan general insurance business, Saham Finance</a>, which it acquired in 2018 by R5.8 billion in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It recently consolidated its African Rainbow Life venture into its existing businesses, saying odds were stacked against it because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mutually beneficial</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Megna Makan, an equity analyst at Benguela Global Fund Managers, said the Sanlam-BrightRock marriage was probably mutually beneficial. When Sanlam bought Brightrock, it was still quite a young company that contributed operational losses in Sanlam&#8217;s books. But the blue insurer now gets to retain or gain market share with BrightRock&#8217;s innovative solutions, said Makan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;BrightRock gets to scale up quicker with the expertise, distribution, and capital backing from Sanlam…Overall, it was probably a mutually beneficial relationship, with Sanlam being an enabler for Brightrock to continue growing and Brightrock bringing its innovation to Sanlam,&#8221; said Makan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added that although Sanlam does not disclose specifics, both parties have been reporting that BrightRock was growing well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Market leader ambitions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, BrightRock increased its market share to 14.3% from 10.8% a year earlier after increasing its new business sales by 10.8%, while big insurers Old Mutual and Liberty recorded double-digit declines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even Sanlam, which grew its business volumes by 25% in 2020, was boosted by the investment inflows. Its life insurance operations only grew new business volumes by 4%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan said BrightRock now insures 2.8 million people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan, who began his career as an actuarial analyst at Discovery Life, might have taken a leaf out of Adrian Gore&#8217;s book on how to turn an entrepreneurial idea into your very own insurance company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when asked if BrightRock could have become the next Discovery if it continued at it alone, without Sanlam, Malan didn&#8217;t want to compare journeys because every entrepreneur works at his or her own pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But do I think that BrightRock is on its way to become the market leader in South Africa from a life insurance point of view? Yes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you look at how our market share has grown in the last year, while the industry as a whole shrank, it means BrightRock took market share from competitors, and significantly so,&#8221; said Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published in Fin24 on 11 March 2021.&nbsp;<a title=\"https://www.news24.com/fin24/companies/financial-services/in-sanlams-shadow-or-lighting-its-own-spark-brightrock-has-market-leader-ambitions-20210412\" href=\"https://www.news24.com/fin24/companies/financial-services/in-sanlams-shadow-or-lighting-its-own-spark-brightrock-has-market-leader-ambitions-20210412\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","sanlam","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":" sanlam&#8217;s shadow lighting its own spark brightrock market leader ambitions ceo schalk malan says insurer way becoming south africa’s life insurance market africa&#8217;s will complete first decade existence this year company which sanlam acquired majority stake 2017 been taking share from big insurers growth trajectory different continues fly solo when came onto scene 2011 had licence own; just few ambitious individuals who gathered around dinner table wanted come with something different ten years later become third biggest new business written by independent brokers 2020 after momentum discovery banking are two industries that have one highest barriers entry his co founding team believe their &#8220;needs matched&#8221; model hit funders customers all allow consumers redirect premiums benefits without buying cover they longer need cover promises cut frills offer cheaper than incumbents &#8220;starting out didn&#8217;t our licence rented lombard group &#8221; said also saw potential brightrock&#8217;s gave financial backing needed get ground launched intermediated individual risk 2012 kind investor what brightrock sold 53% would later attract &#8220; venture capital funder where there&#8217;s appreciation trials challenges business corporate start &#8217;s very difficult them because much more prescriptive &#8221; swallowed enabled sanlam six into existence biggest insurer sanlam spotted strategy seek profitable opportunities tap markets wasn&#8217;t reaching said started conversations about possible deal made clear wouldn&#8217;t compromise independence maintain brand separate sanlam&#8217;s continue running distribution channel through broker network &#8220; look how exposure grown over last five years argue strength achievements &#8221; malan adding numbers show living shadow he encourages independence &#8220;two horses race&#8221; companies compete directly each other rest industry shareholder part group &#8220; enabler&#8221; growth keeping distance allowing steer ship sees fit &#8220;they&#8217;ve point view played significant role maturing governance view &#8221; reckoned acquiring proven successful investment sanlam &#8220;collectively &#8217;ve now ensured top writer view definitely nail head &#8221; malan paul hanratty led faced some recent ventures write down value moroccan general business saham finance 2018 r58 billion 2020 recently consolidated african rainbow existing businesses saying odds were stacked against covid 19 pandemic mutually beneficial megna makan equity analyst benguela global fund managers sanlam brightrock marriage probably beneficial bought still quite young company contributed operational losses books blue gets retain gain innovative solutions makan &#8220;brightrock scale quicker expertise distribution sanlam…overall relationship being enabler growing bringing innovation sanlam &#8221; she added although does disclose specifics both parties reporting well increased 143% 108% year earlier increasing sales 108% while insurers old mutual liberty recorded double digit declines even grew volumes 25% boosted inflows operations only 4% insures 28 million people began career actuarial discovery life might taken leaf out adrian gore&#8217;s book turn entrepreneurial idea your company asked could next continued alone want compare journeys every entrepreneur works her pace &#8220; think africa view yes!

He shared his thoughts on the highs and lows of being in the insurance space during a global pandemic.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Schalk Malan on BrightRock’s journey:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been an amazing journey. We often get asked – especially these last few months getting to that 10 year anniversary – what some of the highlights [are]. One of the key things that stands out, [is] not just the real impact that we’ve made in the market from a product innovation, but having the privilege to be able to cover more than 2.8 million lives and the responsibility that comes with it. But really giving us that sense that we’re making a real impact and difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On the life insurance focus:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock stated from the get-go that we believed in what we were doing in the life insurance space. We also believe that our future does lie in a multi-product, even potentially, multi-market financial services organisation. If you look at the needs of a client, we’ve really focused now on the risk side – life insurance side – which is really protecting that balance sheet from volatility, if something unplanned happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Covid is a great example, but it really goes hand in hand with building the balance sheet – the asset side of things. So absolutely, that would be lying in future thinking. But at the moment, our big focus is really making sure that we capitalise on the opportunities [and] the impact that we’ve made in the risk market – and we’ve made a massive impact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On the impact of Covid-19 on life insurance providers:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been extremely tough for all insurers. You would have seen the claims experience from many insurers, even BrightRock. We paid out more than R880m in claims – just in the Covid year – which is a significant increase. Not just because of business that’s grown, but also the actual claims experience. It’s been a tough period for all insurers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On the activity around funeral policies:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand the impact on the opinions being raised around it being ‘not so serious’. I’ve personally been out to funeral parlours just after the first wave of Covid. Talking and experiencing what they’ve experienced and also just looking at the stats that have come through. Some of these parlours – especially in rural areas – I’ve seen an increase in claims 100%. Covid wave two was slightly less impactful on that, with regards to our lower LSM (living standards measure) communities. But it’s been very, very serious. I can tell you from our experience – during some of those spike periods – we saw claims doubling and and the numbers have been very impactful on those businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On growing BrightRock:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll just talk about last year because I think that’s quite topical in terms of growing market share. We’ve been asked that question a few times as well. If you look at that significant growth – from a 10% to 14% market share – when the market was contracting, I can ascribe it to one easy answer: we actually had no choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of our business is designed to grow [and] to make sure that we can really have solutions for clients and protect them. It’s an attitudinal thing. We just had to find positive solutions and not just say ‘okay, how do we just protect our existing book?’ Because as we know, a lot of solutions were out there in terms of premium holidays. Yes, we had that as well, but that was a small part of what we had in mind. We actually said, ‘let’s actually get out there quicker and engage with our brokers; let’s engage with our clients proactively’. Finding solutions to still grow the business and have that mindset. I think that played a big part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published on BizNews on 31 March 2021.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.biznews.com/thought-leaders/2021/03/31/life-insurance-brightrock\">Click here&nbsp;</a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["biznews","brightrock","business-growth","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"new ways take life insurance with ceo brightrock schalk malan brightrock shared his thoughts highs lows being space during global pandemic told biznews power hour that they now have 25 distribution hubs two administration offices around sa making real difference industry he malan brightrock’s journey: ’s been amazing journey often get asked – especially these last few months getting 10 year anniversary what some highlights [are] one key things stands out [] just impact ’ve made market from product innovation having privilege able cover more than 28 million lives responsibility comes really giving us sense ’re difference focus: stated get go believed were doing space also believe our future does lie multi product even potentially multi market financial services organisation look needs client focused risk side which protecting balance sheet volatility something unplanned happens covid great example goes hand building asset things absolutely would lying thinking moment big focus sure capitalise opportunities [] massive impact &nbsp; covid 19 providers: extremely tough all insurers seen claims experience many insurers brightrock paid out r880m significant increase because business that’s grown actual experience period insurers &nbsp; activity funeral policies: understand opinions raised ‘ serious’ ’ve personally parlours after first wave covid talking experiencing they’ve experienced looking stats come through rural areas increase 100% slightly less impactful that regards lower lsm (living standards measure) communities very very serious can tell those spike periods saw doubling numbers businesses growing brightrock: ’ll talk about think quite topical terms share question times well growth 10% 14% share when contracting ascribe easy answer: actually had choice part designed grow make solutions clients protect them attitudinal thing find positive say ‘okay how existing book ’ know lot there premium holidays yes well small mind said ‘let’s quicker engage brokers; let’s proactively’ finding still mindset played part this article originally published 31 march 2021 &nbsp; click here&nbsp; read original online version content staging news business growth schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":22048,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22049,"date":"24 Mar, 21","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Needs-matched life insurer BrightRock announces strong growth in 2020","excerpt":"<p>BrightRock announces strong growth in 2020, despite COVID-19’s challenges.</p>\n","illustration":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"now-in-its-10th-year-needs-matched-life-insurer-brightrock-announces-strong-growth-in-2020-despite-covid-19s-challenges","content":"\n<p><strong>Key performance indicators</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Total cover in force exceeds R350 billion, up by 13.7% from 2019.</li><li>Total annualised premium income increased by 12.5% to R2.1 billion.</li><li>Total claims paid of more than R882 million in 2020 – claims paid to date of more than R2,38 billion</li><li>BrightRock ranked third in terms of new business annual risk premiums written by independent financial providers in 2020*</li><li>Market share increases to 14.3% in 2020 from 10.8% in 2019*</li><li>BrightRock, once again, was the fastest-growing insurer in its segment in this period*</li><li>10,8% increase in new business sales (2019 versus the same period of 2020)*</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>24 March 2021, Sandton – </strong>Needs-matched life insurer BrightRock has released an update on its business performance across its individual life, group life and funeral assistance business. Despite the tough market conditions and trying times in the industry, BrightRock delivered industry-leading growth for the 2020 financial year – which CEO Schalk Malan attributes to a variety of initiatives undertaken to support clients and financial advisers during theCOVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan reflected on the past 12 months and the effects of the pandemic, saying that while the long-term insurance industry is financially strong and managed to weather the impact of the pandemic, it did see a slowdown in new business growth. This is borne out by recent long-term insurance statistics for 2020 released by the Association for Savings and Investments of South Africa (ASISA), which showed fewer risk policies sold, increased claims experience and lapse rates for the industry. However, Malan states that BrightRock withstood these conditions better than most, with growing support from clients and financial advisers propelling it into third place in the individual risk broker market with a market share of 14,3% (based on annual premium income), and a 10,8% increase in new business sales. This is the greatest overall increase in new business relative to other providers in that segment, with the market declining by 16.5% on average over the same period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“BrightRock’s growth is particularly remarkable when you consider this tough economic climate. The pandemic and resulting lockdowns have had a significant effect on our economy, with many businesses having to close or shed jobs over the past year. The impact on consumers’ health and their pockets has in turn resulted in challenging conditions for insurers, but we’re proud to have played our part in making some of the changes easier for many of our clients. To date, we’ve paid almost R2,4 billion in claims to our clients with a total of over R882 million paid in claims last year,” says Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solutions to support clients and financial advisers during COVID-19</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking about BrightRock’s purpose and its response to the COVID-19, Malan said: “The reason why we do what we do is to help our clients navigate change in their lives through our needs‑matched life insurance product.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The last year certainly required all of us to quickly adapt and change the way we worked and lived. We needed to find ways to help support our financial advisers and continue giving them and our clients good service. As a company, we were able to respond rapidly and offer solutions both for new and existing clients during these trying times.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Malan, one of the ways this was done was by offering BrightRock advisers and clients the opportunity to use the extra-cover buy-up to secure more cover. The extra cover buy-up is a standard BrightRock product feature that allows qualifying policyholders to increase their cover with no medical underwriting if their needs change, up to a maximum amount. He said this was important in the lockdown period, as people could not go for insurance medicals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Through the capabilities that BrightRock has built over the past decade to streamline our new business processes, we were able to switch to a paperless environment immediately. This ensured that financial advisers and clients could still secure cover.” Other examples included BrightRock’s Advanced Underwriting option, which fast-tracks the underwriting process for clients who are healthy, and meet certain criteria, making it possible for new clients to get cover without insurance medicals. BrightRock further introduced underwriting concessions to defer medicals until after the lockdown period, as well as a premium relief option for clients facing income constraints at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New product enhancements announced</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock’s needs-matched life insurance is a world-first and Malan believes that its innovative product offering also played a fundamental role in its continued growth. BrightRock announced further enhancements to its individual risk product in November 2020, including a full-term premium guarantee for death cover, building upon the principles of premium and cover certainty that BrightRock has advocated since its market entry. It also launched two change moment pay-outs, which add even more efficiency and value to the market-leading income protection benefits and provide clients with pay-outs for two Change Moments. These are the client’s retirement, and when they expect their children to reach financial independence – Change Moments where clients may need a little extra money to help with any unexpected expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BrightRock’s 10th anniversary</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of BrightRock’s prospects for the 2021 financial year, Malan looked forward to a milestone year for BrightRock: “We started BrightRock almost a decade ago with a dream to change the life insurance industry for good. We’ll be celebrating our tenth anniversary on 30 May this year and it is gratifying to see what has been achieved to date. What’s more, we believe that there is tremendous scope for continued growth”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has grown rapidly from a zero-base start in 2011 and now covers more than 2,8 million lives with 25 distribution hubs nationwide serving more than 5,000 contracted Independent Financial Advisers. This is in addition to its tied adviser force, BrightRock Financial Advisers, which was started in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As a company, we are continuously looking for ways to provide even more certainty to our clients when their needs change, and the figures mentioned above, as well as our growth over the past 10 years, show just what an invaluable role we play in our clients’ lives,” concludes Malan.<a></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-theme-black-color\">*According to NMG Risk Distribution Monitor: South Africa Underwritten Life All Channels_BrightRock; March 2021.

I spent some of it on living expenses, which mostly included work suits, because coming straight from university into corporate, this farm boy in his vellies was just not ready for Sandton. A large portion of my first salary also went to my first home.

But I’d rather focus on a very underrated virtue, which is curiosity &#8230; the &#8220;why&#8221; is what drives people to find solutions and try new things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you could fix only one thing in SA, what would it be?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Education.

In other words, that I should ask myself: &#8220;What is the worst that can happen if I take the risk, and what is the potential reward?&#8221; Most things are just maths problems waiting to be solved — but I also enjoy the scenarios I can’t predict.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is something you would go back and tell your younger self that would impress them?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will be part of founding a company that changes the life insurance industry for the better.

And, just as a rugby team needs the efforts of every teammate to fulfil its mission, it also needs opponents. In 2020, rugby players, like other sportspeople, faced some of their toughest opponents yet: the pandemic, a more intense schedule and the absence of spectators. But amidst all of this, the players never quit; instead, they displayed immense resilience and endurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bearing this in mind, the fourth Annual BrightRock Players Choice Awards are all the more important, given the tough environment of 2020. These awards, in partnership with MyPlayers, honour and recognise the commitment, determination and talent of South African rugby players. The winners are decided by their peers – South Africa’s professional rugby players – in a voting process that is facilitated by MyPlayers, the South African professional rugby players’ organisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this year’s votes were counted, Springbok stalwart and Bulls captain Duane Vermeulen came out tops, beating his fellow nominees to win the coveted 2020 Players’ Player of the Year award, as well as the Forward Player of the Year award, both of which were won by Pieter-Steph du Toit in 2019. The &nbsp;title of Players’ Player of the Year is awarded to the player selected by their peers as the best rugby player of the year. A week ago, Vermeulen was named SA Rugby Player of the Year, and this is the second time, including 2014, that he receives South Africa’s two most coveted player awards in a single year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Duane Vermeulen had an amazing season, despite the barriers presented by the pandemic, and his two awards reflect this. On behalf of MyPlayers, we would like to congratulate all the winners who contributed to the game and entertained us with the great rugby that they have played this past season. Rugby remains one of the most popular sports in our country, and we are fortunate to have a committed partner in BrightRock that makes it possible for the players to have this platform where they can recognise their peers. Many thanks to BrightRock and our MyPlayers team for the great work they have done over the last four years to produce these awards,” said Eugene Henning, Chief Executive Officer of MyPlayers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the winner of two categories, Vermeulen pledged his total winnings of R10 000 to the Chris Burger Petro Jackson Players’ Fund.“Assisting those in need is something close to my heart, and I couldn’t think of a better way to assist those in need than donating my total winnings to the Chris Burger Petro Jackson Players’ Fund, which&nbsp;has been rugby’s caring hand for over 40 years. My donation is a small token of appreciation and an opportunity to thank the Players’ Fund for the pivotal role they play, in caring for the South African’s who suffer life-changing injuries through rugby. Hopefully, my donation can make a change in one person’s life,”Vermeulen said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other winners who best played the bounce during this challenging season and received the recognition of their peers are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Defender of the Year – </strong>Lukhanyo Am &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Best off the Bench – </strong>Morné van den Berg</li><li><strong>Backline Player of the Year – </strong>Wandisile Simelane</li><li><strong>The LoveChange Award (for the most improved player) – </strong>Vincent Tshituka</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock Deputy CEO, Suzanne Stevens, says, “One thing South Africans know is how to stand strong when it comes to change. At BrightRock, we believe that with all change, there is an opportunity. Being able to ‘love change’ is a skill we as South Africans possess, we’re naturally a ‘change fit’ bunch! That is why these awards are important and a necessity during these unprecedented times. They are our way of honouring our players for their resilience and for inspiring us amid all the changes that are happening in the world today.”<em> </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sport, which is inherently unpredictable, provides the perfect platform to share the message of embracing change and tackling the unexpected head-on. In BrightRock’s partnership with MyPlayers, the power of sport to drive positive change has been harnessed by acknowledging the amazing triumphs made by South Africa’s top rugby talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The BrightRock Players Choice Awards Categories</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All nominations were compiled by the MyPlayers Board, their Trustees and player representatives, and the winners of each category were selected by the players. The winner in each category also earns the charity of his choice a R5 000 donation, funded from the players’ collective commercial rights income and managed by MyPlayers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defender of the Year</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winner: </strong><strong>Lukhanyo Am (Sharks)</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nominees:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Jeandré Rudolph (Cheetahs)</li><li>Andisa Ntsila (Cheetahs)</li><li>Steven Kitshoff (Stormers/WP)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Best off the Bench&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winner: Morné van den Berg</strong><strong> (Lions)</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nominees:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Thembelani Bholi (Sharks)</li><li>Arno Botha (Bulls)</li><li>Sintu Manjezi (Bulls)</li><li>Forward Player of the Year &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winner: </strong><strong>Duane Vermeulen (Bulls)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nominees:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Steven Kitshoff (Bulls)</li><li>Jeandré Rudolph (Cheetahs)</li><li>Marco van Staden (Bulls)</li><li>Backline Player of the Year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winner: </strong><strong>Wandisile Simelane (Lions)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nominees:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cornal Hendricks (Bulls)</li><li>Frans Steyn (Cheetahs)</li><li>Curwin Bosch (Sharks)</li><li>The LoveChange Award</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winner: </strong><strong>Vincent Tshituka (Lions)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nominees:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stedman Gans (Bulls)</li><li>Tiaan Swanepoel (Lions)</li><li>Dylan Richardson (Sharks)</li><li>Players’ Player of the Year &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winner: </strong><strong>Duane Vermeulen (Bulls)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nominees:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Frans Steyn (Cheetahs)</li><li>Cornal Hendricks (Bulls)</li><li>Curwin Bosch (Sharks)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>[ENDS]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Issued by BrightRock in partnership with MyPlayers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About BrightRock</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock is a disrupter in the South African life insurance market, offering clients and financial advisers’ solutions that can be co-created to precisely meet their needs.

Some are stronger, some are faster, and some are meaner than others. But last year, every player, no matter their team or position, faced an opponent like never before. An opponent that changed the conditions, that changed the play, that changed the rules again and again. So, this year, we will salute the players who took the battle to this opponent. Who stood up to the Covid-19 pandemic, adapted and faced it the best way that rugby players know how to – face on.<br><br><strong>The BrightRock Players Choice Awards 2020&nbsp;in partnership with MyPlayers</strong> will honour these superstars who played the bounce the best during this challenging time. As always, the winners will be decided by the players in South Africa’s only annual awards events for professional rugby players by professional rugby players. Eighteen players were nominated in the six categories, and the winners will be announced during an awards ceremony that will soon by pinned to the 2021 rugby calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Smit – former World Cup-winning Springbok captain, MyPlayers board member and the recipient of the 2005 Players’ Player of the Year award – remarked on the significance of The BrightRock Players Choice Awards: “Nothing about 2020 was ideal or perfect – every week presented new challenges to players’ fitness, health, performance and mental welfare. To be nominated in one of the six categories suggests so much more about these players than just an acknowledgement of their talent and abilities. It also recognises character and mental fortitude in the most uncertain and disruptive season that most professional rugby players have ever been exposed to.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;On a personal level, Smit recounted what the Players’ Player Award meant to him in 2005:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s something altogether different about the award. You receive this recognition from your peers, and that stands out for me as one of the highlights of my career. Great teams consist of individuals who work together toward their collective goals. The individual is never bigger than the team, but the confidence and performance of individual players enable the team to excel. As a player, you care about your team and about the value you bring to the environment. So, there is no greater individual accolade in team sports than to be recognised by your teammates and opponents. The annual BrightRock Players Choice Awards celebrate this dynamic between the collective and individual effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I want to congratulate all the nominees. You exemplify the power of the human spirit, and there is no reason for you to doubt the merits of your nomination. Your fellow players – those individuals who know and understand you intimately – decided that you are worthy of their praise.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock Deputy CEO, Suzanne Stevens, joined in Smit’s praise of the nominees: “Rugby, like life, is a game where the unpredictable is always a play away and can challenge even the best skill and preparation. At BrightRock, we love change and we believe that embracing life’s curveballs can create opportunities – something that these players demonstrated so well in 2020. We’re very proud to be able to partner with MyPlayers yet again in acknowledging the nominees’ extraordinary achievements in such a challenging year for rugby.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Africa’s professional rugby players will have until 21 February to cast their vote for their favourite player in&nbsp;each category.

If great advice is a product, what are the differentiating features that set it apart?</p>\n","illustration":"https://changeexchange.studio/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sean-Hanlon_Executive-Director.png","illustrationBackup":"https://res.cloudinary.com/iamme/image/upload/v1653823283/brightrock/br_logo2.jpg","slug":"advice-has-become-the-product","content":"\n<p><em>If great advice is a product, what are the differentiating features that set it apart?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the new buzz words doing the rounds in the business world is the concept of PaaS, short for &#8216;Product-as-a-Service&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A needs-matched approach</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It refers to a business model where companies allow their clients to purchase a desired result, rather than just the components needed to achieve the result. It is an approach made possible by emerging technology, and the growing demand from consumers, to be able to access what they need when they need it, as efficiently as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The approach also relies on the ability of product providers to package a bundle of products and services together, to achieve the desired outcome for their clients. Think about Uber, for example, where clients can get from point A to point B using a single interface that combines booking, confirmation, navigation and tracking, cashless payment, and access to secure, reliable transport &#8211; all packaged together conveniently on their mobile devices and available on-demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This focus on a client&#8217;s needs or desired outcomes is a central tenet of a needs-matched approach, and it is a concept that financial advisers understand intuitively. An adviser&#8217;s role is to work with clients to define a desired result and to bundle together a set of solutions that aim to achieve the results identified. Great advisers are those that go beyond selling a product, to selling a set of outcomes that correspond to clients&#8217; financial needs and aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features that set great advice apart</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If great advice is a product, however, what are the differentiating features that set it apart?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Great advice should be:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Customised, accessible and flexible</strong> &#8211; both the advice and the product solutions offered must be tailored to each individual client&#8217;s specific needs &#8211; and this extends not just to the performance of the product, but also to the services that go hand-in-hand with the product.</li><li><strong>Fit-for-purpose </strong>&#8211; the advice and product solutions should deliver the most comprehensive cover possible, to limit clients&#8217; financial risk and exposure. And where affordability constraints leave gaps, the adviser is critical to helping clients understand these.</li><li><strong>High-quality solutions at an affordable price </strong>&#8211; both for independent advisers and their tied counterparts, the choice of product is key. Financial advisers have the ability, through a rigorous advice process and in-depth industry knowledge and experience, to understand their clients&#8217; needs and, just as importantly, to help their clients understand how the  products offered by the adviser can meet the clients&#8217; needs &#8211; and which, if any, of those needs cannot be met by the proposed solution. The choice of dynamic, innovative product technology that can support and enable financial advice ensures that both clients&#8217; and advisers&#8217; needs are met.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Embodimentof the PaaSmodel</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great advisers need to have access to good quality financial products and services to be able to deliver to their clients. An adviser that is caring, knowledgeable, diligent and committed to building a long-term, personal relationship with their clients, is the embodiment of the PaaS business model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to ReMark&#8217;s Annual Global Consumer Study, clients expect their advisers to make the advice process both personal and seamless. Over 40% of consumers preferred contactless channels in 2020 &#8211; this almost doubled from 2019. This was for all aspects of life, not just insurance. However, when looking at insurance, consumers still trust their advisers and, in fact, their interest in face-to-face, human advice has increased with 42.2% of the respondents in 2020 saying they trust automated services less than human advice. This is up significantly from 33.5% in 2019. On the claims side, this was even higher with 50% of people preferring human contact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line is that great advice boils down to human relationships &#8211; albeit facilitated, at certain points of the interaction, through convenient, contactless channels. But in the end, the successful adviser &#8211; whether tied or independent &#8211; is the one who focuses on their clients&#8217; needs first and foremost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article first appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/publication/pdf_242_fanewsfebr2021#page=19\">page 19 of the FANews Magazine</a>&nbsp;published in February 2021 and is attributed to Sean Hanlon, BrightRock Executive</em> Director</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","fanews","financial-adviser","sean-hanlon"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"advice become product brightrock product great product what are differentiating features that set apart one new buzz words doing rounds business world concept paas short &#8216;product service&#8217; needs matched approach refers model where companies allow their clients purchase desired result rather than just components needed achieve result made possible by emerging technology growing demand from consumers able access they need when efficiently possible also relies ability providers package bundle products services together outcome clients think about uber example can get point b using single interface combines booking confirmation navigation tracking cashless payment secure reliable transport &#8211; all packaged together conveniently mobile devices available demand this focus client&#8217;s needs outcomes central tenet approach financial advisers understand intuitively adviser&#8217;s role work with define result solutions aim results identified those go beyond selling correspond clients&#8217; aspirations apart however should : customised accessible flexible both offered must tailored each individual specific extends performance hand hand fit purpose deliver most comprehensive cover possible limit risk exposure affordability constraints leave gaps adviser critical helping these high quality affordable price independent tied counterparts choice key have ability through rigorous process depth industry knowledge experience importantly help how meet which any cannot met proposed solution dynamic innovative technology support enable ensures advisers&#8217; met embodimentof paasmodel good quality caring knowledgeable diligent committed building long term personal relationship clients embodiment paas model according remark&#8217;s annual global consumer study expect make seamless over 40% consumers preferred contactless channels 2020 almost doubled 2019 aspects life insurance looking insurance still trust fact interest face face human increased 422% respondents saying automated less advice significantly 335% claims side even higher 50% people preferring contact bottom line boils down relationships albeit facilitated certain points interaction convenient channels end successful whether who focuses first foremost article appeared &nbsp; page 19 fanews magazine &nbsp;published february 2021 attributed sean hanlon executive director content staging news financial adviser sean hanlon"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":21263,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["video"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":7233,"date":"16 Nov, 20","author":"BrightRock","heading":"To thrive in a pandemic, you need to reinvent your business","excerpt":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to many debates.

But if there’s one thing commentators appear to be united in, it’s the certainty that our world will be forever changed by it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve all heard the phrase the ‘new normal’, and some economists have predicted that most businesses will have to fundamentally change the way they operate to be able to succeed in a post-COVID global economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is, that this is entirely possible – science tells us so. Businesses that are sufficiently agile and creative have the potential to pivot and reinvent themselves, and ultimately stay relevant both during this pandemic and after the dust has settled. The pivot process is multifaceted: it involves forming new habits, adopting a committed growth mindset, and behaving like a hungry and innovative start-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In behavioural science, there’s a term for the kind of behaviour that sets apart the individuals who are able to succeed when faced with similar challenges where their peers tend to fail. It’s called ‘Positive Deviance’, and it’s a capacity that allows these people to come up with better solutions. Positive deviance calls for an openness, and optimism of behaviour first rather than thought – in essence, the mindset that it’s “easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than it is to think your into a new way of acting&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equipped with these tools, success in the wake of Covid-19 is entirely possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Combine powerful new habits with a growth mindset</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans are all too familiar with the need to change, it has been a critical part of our survival for millennia. It has also been studied in detail and the science of how and why people change is well known and established. What Covid-19 has made abundantly clear, is that businesses are no different. Companies both big and small are capable of adapting to the prevailing circumstances – and indeed of thriving amid them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strong leadership is crucial to the success of this adaptation. Even at the best of times, good leaders can help businesses to maximise productivity and achieve their goals. During times of crisis, good business leadership involves forming new habits to make change possible and keeping a firm and steady gaze on the potential for growth. Doing so can lead to important shifts in the way your business works, in the way it engages with its client base, and the way it solves problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it can feel daunting to consider changing systems and processes at a time of uncertainty, this lateral-thinking approach is the very thing that makes growth and success achievable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Think like a start-up</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to adopt this growth mindset is to think like an entrepreneur starting a business. Start-ups focus on what makes good strategic sense, they prioritise innovation and they’re quick to adapt to change. Be like a start-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Don’t be afraid to challenge the status quo</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Entrepreneurs look around and ask, “Why does everyone do this the same way?” They start with a blank piece of paper before them and write down ideas that are entirely new and fresh. Businesses that disrupt the status quo, particularly during a crisis, can position themselves at the cutting edge of their industries. The result is growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Form multi-disciplinary teams</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unprecedented problems need to be met with a diverse range of knowledge and skills. A narrow approach is only going to reduce, or even eliminate, your chances of success. You need to be able to look at things from a variety of different perspectives and find a number of different solutions to any given challenge. This requires different people with different skills-sets to be seated at your table.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Be curious and creative</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Go beyond your own context for inspiration. You might be surprised at the parallels that can be drawn between sectors and industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Leap into action and start doing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start-ups are bold. They turn their engines on quickly in order to put some of their ideas into practice. They think carefully and strategically, but then swiftly take the plunge to see whether their ideas have scope for success. Making this part of your approach will likely distinguish you from your competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When BrightRock was founded, we realised that things could be done differently. We wanted to create a new type of life insurance that would give clients and financial advisers the tools to co-create a solution that precisely met their individual needs – even when those needs changed. Agility has been the name of our game from the very beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, BrightRock is the fastest-growing insurer in our market segment, and we provide cover that is both relevant and appropriate to each and every individual client. In fact, according to the NMG Risk Distribution Monitor for Quarter 2 – the hard lockdown period – BrightRock was the only life insurer to increase new business by 4% in a period when the industry as a whole saw a 38% reduction (compared to the same period in 2019).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Embrace risk – strategically</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our experience has taught us that nothing in business is guaranteed. You have to perform and get better at whatever you do, or you will lose your competitive advantage. These uncertain times may tempt some businesses into being more risk averse, but in many instances, being decisive in this time is what will set you apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For several years, BrightRock has combined its crafting of personalised insurance solutions with an entirely different space: content creation and communication. The BrightRock Change Exchange, as it is known, offers readers the opportunity to understand life&#8217;s biggest change moments by learning from the experiences of others. This online platform also offers helpful tools, apps and expert opinions. And the content that we publish there is informed by and inspired by the latest scientific thinking around how people adapt to change in their lives.

All other figures are as of 31 August 2020 and include BrightRock’s individual life, group life and life assistance business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>3 November 2020, Sandton </strong>– Needs-matched life insurer, BrightRock has provided an update on its business performance and growth during its annual product briefing session for financial advisers, where it also launched enhancements to its product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growth during the lockdown period</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking at a virtual presentation to over 1&nbsp;000 financial advisers, BrightRock CEO, Schalk Malan, reflected over the last few months and the effects of the lockdown, saying that the impact for the business was significant, as with most financial sector providers. However, looking at the industry, it appears that BrightRock weathered the lockdown better than most, with a 4% increase in new business was written over the quarter (for the second quarter of 2019 versus the same period of 2020). More than that, BrightRock was the only life insurance company to show positive growth in new business premiums written, with the market declining by 38% on average over the same period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the NMG Risk Distribution Monitor: South Africa Underwritten Life All Channels report from August 2020, BrightRock had the second-largest share of new business written by independent financial advisers in South Africa during the second quarter of 2020. The survey indicates that the life insurer accounts for an overall share of just over 16% of all new business sold by independent financial advisers for the same quarter, based on annual premium income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“BrightRock has also rallied well after the hard lockdown period, with a record new business month in July and again in September,” said Malan. He said that BrightRock’s performance figures to the end of August 2020 affirm its growth in the market. The needs-matched insurer continued to deliver strong growth and new business annualised premium income grew to R1.85 billion, despite tough economic conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are particularly proud of BrightRock’s track record in terms of paying claims. To date, we have paid over R2.1 billion in claims – in many instances paying out higher amounts and paying for claims that other providers wouldn’t cover.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Malan, total cover in force now amounts to over R309 billion, with more than two and half million lives covered across BrightRock’s individual life, life assistance and group risk offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solutions to support clients and financial advisers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan attributes this performance to a variety of initiatives undertaken to support clients and financial advisers during the lockdown period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were able to respond rapidly and offer solutions both for new and existing clients during these trying times. For example, we could offer our advisers and clients the opportunity to use the extra-cover buy-up to secure more cover.” The extra cover buy-up is a standard BrightRock product feature that allows qualifying policyholders to increase their cover with no medical underwriting if their needs change, up to a maximum amount. Malan said this was important in the lockdown period, as people could not go for insurance medicals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Through the capabilities, BrightRock has built over the past few years to streamline our new business processes, we were able to switch to a paperless environment immediately. This ensured that financial advisers and clients could still secure cover.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of this include BrightRock’s Advanced Underwriting option, which fast-tracks the underwriting process for clients who are healthy, and meet certain criteria, and made it possible for new clients to get cover during this time without a nurse visit or medicals. BrightRock further introduced underwriting concessions to defer medicals until after the lockdown period, as well as a premium relief option for clients facing income constraints at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New product enhancements announced</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the financial adviser briefing session, BrightRock also announced enhancements to its individual risk product. This included a full-term premium guarantee to introduce more premium certainty. Malan notes that this new guarantee builds upon the principles of premium and cover certainty that BrightRock has advocated since its market entry. This addition ensures that qualifying death cover premium increases are guaranteed in full for the entire duration of the cover, up to the whole of life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Certainty through a brand-new guarantee on all full premium increases for death cover means that BrightRock clients will know exactly how much their premiums on their death cover will increase by for the entire duration of their policy, even if the policy covers the rest of their lives.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, BrightRock also launched two change moment pay-outs, which add even more efficiency and value to the market-leading income protection benefits and provide clients with pay-outs for two Change Moments. These are the client’s retirement, and when they expect their children to reach financial independence – Change Moments where clients may need a little extra money to help with any unexpected expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The retirement change moment pay-out gives clients an added pay-out for 10 years after they have reached their selected retirement age. The childcare change moment pay-out gives clients an additional sum of money when their children reach the age where they expect them to achieve financial independence. These pay-outs are only available where clients have protected their remaining pay cheques with needs-matched cover for household, healthcare, or childcare needs because its efficient structure allows BrightRock to deliver significantly more cover to clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“BrightRock has always been committed to changing the industry for the better. We’ve been able to demonstrate the power of embracing change and being adaptable within it – and certainly, over the course of this unprecedented year, it has been a critical tool both internally and among our clients,” concluded Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About BrightRock</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrightRock is a disrupter in the South African life insurance market, offering clients and financial advisers unique solutions that better meet their needs.

For this next part in our Covid-19 series, we reached out to local specialists to answer this question, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are you covered for Covid-19?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Ruvan J. Grobler, business development and wealth manager at Bovest Wealth Management, policy holders of the major Insurers in South Africa should have no exclusions on these types of pandemics or Covid-19 related claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In short, yes, they will pay out if you die as a result of contracting the virus,” says Grobler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“However, it’s important to remember that there are several insurers in South Africa and each of them assess claims differently. Every policy holder should consult with a reputable adviser for more information on how and when to claim, as there are certain case-by-case variables,” says Grobler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anton Keet, head of risk services at 1Life Insurance, agrees that, if you have natural life cover, death caused by Covid-19 would be covered on all valid claims as it would be considered a natural cause of death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Normal claims requirements would apply, should you pass away from a Covid-19 related death. This includes a death certificate, proof of policy, and beneficiary details,” says Keet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Has the coronavirus increased the cost of overall premiums?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Deidre Wolmarans, head of service at Metropolitan, no upward adjustments to premiums have been made as a result of Covid-19, and no adjustments to premiums for new and existing clients are foreseen in the near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our products are designed to not only help clients during tough times but also to withstand extreme events, like the one we’re going through,” says Wolmarans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, she explains that the Metropolitan Funeral Plan was designed to allow clients to miss up to four premiums before their policy lapses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolmarans points out that the majority of Metropolitan’s products do not require extensive underwriting, such as blood tests, which makes it possible for clients to get cover. Therefore, the product range did not need to be adjusted as a result of Covid-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We understand the importance of being covered, particularly during this time and have made it easy for clients to obtain cover to protect themselves as well as their loved ones,” says Wolmarans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contracting the coronavirus during your waiting period</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Felix Kagura, head of life insurance propositions at Standard Bank Insurance, there are no specific terms and conditions that exclude clients from claiming as a result of Covid-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, he adds that in some cases there may be exclusions emanating from the fact that other conditions of the cover haven’t been fulfilled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For example, some of our policies have a waiting period and if the unfortunate happens within the waiting period then the client isn’t covered,” says Kagura.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What if Covid-19 is a pre-existing condition?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Darryn Padayachee, chief financial officer at African Rainbow Life, when applying for life cover, you have to answer a health questionnaire that contains seven medical questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explains that part of this is a declaration on pre-existing conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If it turns out that you knew you had Covid-19 at the time of taking out the cover, this would be considered a pre-exisiting condition and would not be covered,” says Padayachee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What about critical illness cover and disability cover?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Schalk Malan, CEO of BrightRock, the coronavirus is not a clinical definition under any of the clinical definitions documents for the different types of cover available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, BrightRock’s clients can still claim under their policies if they meet the necessary criteria. Whether or not a client can claim under their policy will depend on the type of cover they’re submitting a claim for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Temporary disability cover:</strong>&nbsp;Clients can claim under this cover if they contract the coronavirus. They might qualify for a claim if they’ve been booked off work after being diagnosed with the virus for longer than their waiting period. This means that if a client has a waiting period of one month, they need to be booked off by a doctor for longer than one month.</li><li><strong>Permanent disability cover:</strong>&nbsp;If a client meets the criteria for a permanent expenses claim – that is if they’re permanently disabled and unable to work in their current occupation due to contracting the virus – then they’ll be able to claim under this cover. Clients can only qualify to be assessed under the occupational criteria, but they might still be entitled to a claim payment if they meet the claim criteria under one of the clinical definitions.</li><li><strong>Critical illness cover:</strong>&nbsp;Covid-19 isn’t a clinical definition under this cover, so clients won’t be able to claim for this diagnosis under critical illness cover. If a client suffers complications due to the coronavirus, which meets one of BrightRock’s over 300 clinical definitions under its critical illness cover, they might be able to qualify for a claim.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that every insurer is different and it’s best to contact your service provider directly to find out about the company’s critical illness cover and disability cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This article first appeared on 09 July 2020 in JustMoney, written by &nbsp;Isabelle Coetzee.

BrightRock’s needs-matched life insurance addresses these shortcomings by pricing cover correctly for the term and trajectory required</em></strong></span></h4>\n<p><strong>Johannesburg, 18 February 2015</strong> – Since its launch in early 2012 BrightRock’s needs-matched life insurance offering has helped to drive a change in mind-set in the life industry. Needs-matched life insurance challenges some of its most entrenched beliefs about how risk cover should be structured to meet those needs.</p>\n<p>According to Schalk Malan, Executive Director at BrightRock, for many years, the life industry has been providing blocks of cover that grow –to a maximum term, &nbsp;usually retirement age – with a premium that increases too.&nbsp; However, he says that as clients reach retirement age their risk profile changes and industry statistics on claims confirm that clients actually reduce their cover over time– they have fewer pay cheques to protect and large debts are settled.</p>\n<p>Yet policyholders’ policies are designed, and priced, to provide the highest level of cover when their insurance need is lowest. This is confirmed by the True South insurance gap study, commissioned by the Association for Savings and Investments of South Africa (ASISA), which finds that earners in the older age categories tend to be over-insured. According to the study’s findings: “[T]he Insurance Need for older Earners is a much smaller multiple than current earnings compared to younger Earners.”</p>\n<p>Malan concurs, citing the following example, “For a 60-year-old male, the likelihood of a disability claim is nine times higher than it is for a 40-year-old male. So it would be reasonable to anticipate that the disability claims of 60-year-olds would be nine times higher than those of 40-year-olds – for the same cover in force. Yet our analysis of three life insurers’ claims data shows that the disability cover paid out for policyholders over the age of 50 years is in the region of 85-95% less than expected. This proves that there is a massive reduction in the level of cover in force by the time the clients reach the age bands over 51 years.”</p>\n<p>“This lower level of cover in force closer to retirement age demonstrates that clients are reducing their cover with time because their financial exposure and need for cover is reducing too or simply just lapse out of the system because of affordability or complete change in needs. And, due to underwriting limitations, they cannot then seek cover on another product like critical illness.”</p>\n<p>However, the average capital disability policy sold in the market is priced to retirement, usually about 25 years and it is set to grow over this period. What this means for the consumer is that, in effect, when looking at industry claims data, most policies sold today are priced to increase for the term, but behave like decreasing term insurance products – yet clients are paying from day one for increasing cover priced for the maximum policy term – leading to premium waste.</p>\n<p>Says Malan, “In effect, clients are paying a considerable amount for wasted premiums – they are paying from rand one for the sacrificed cover which could have secured much more efficiently and appropriately structured cover upfront. In addition, clients are less insurable at older ages. Should they later need to increase cover for critical illnesses, they may find that they’re no longer insurable.</p>\n<p>“Because needs-matched cover is priced accurately for the correct term based on the client’s financial exposure, BrightRock clients get almost double the cover up-front. BrightRock’s needs-matched life insurance is the only life insurance that sets and prices cover to map the trajectory of the client’s actual financial need at every point of the policy’s duration.”</p>\n<p>The efficiency applies not only to capital disability cover but to life cover too, so on average, BrightRock clients are able to buy about 40% more cover on their whole policy using needs-matched technology than they would with a competitor for the same premium. “Considering the R24 trillion gap in life insurance cover – and the role that affordability of premiums plays in these high levels of underinsurance – needs-matched premium efficiency can help financial advisers close the gaps in their clients’ cover,” says Malan.</p>\n<p>Malan discussed these issues against the backdrop of anticipated regulatory change in the life insurance industry, including the Treating Customers Fairly framework and recent Retail Distribution Review RDR proposals – which seek to prevent mis-selling and secure better outcomes for clients. “BrightRock was born of this new TCF era and our product design has in many respects anticipated the changes that are currently being mooted.”</p>\n<p>According to Malan, in this changing regulatory environment where the focus is increasingly on meeting consumer needs, BrightRock’s needs-matched design creates significant opportunities for the life insurance player going forward. Malan has been invited to speak in Germany and Australia about BrightRock’s product structure and the way it addresses the regulatory and consumerist challenges faced by the life insurance industry internationally.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited about the possibilities this new technology creates – not only for the growth of our business – but for the future of our industry,” Malan concludes.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff9900;\">What does this mean for consumers?</span></h3>\n<p>Malan suggests that policyholders meet regularly with their financial advisers to check the level and term of their capital disability cover, and ensure that it’s right for their needs. He has the following tips for you and your adviser:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check for underinsurance at younger ages – your greatest financial asset is your ability to earn an income, so it is important is protect your future pay cheques until retirement. And while you’re more likely to suffer an illness or injury the closer you get to retirement, your financial exposure is highest in your thirties and forties when you’ve got more pay cheques to cover and a higher outstanding debt on your home loan;</li>\n<li>Check for over-insurance at older ages – if your cover is set to grow steeply over time, you may be overpaying today for cover that you’re likely to reduce anyway as you get closer to retirement age and your financial exposure decreases;</li>\n<li>Ask your financial adviser about your premium funding pattern – often, if affordability is an issue, your financial adviser may choose an age-rated funding pattern for you. This means your cover may start off cheaper at the outset but may increase steeply as you age, with your cover increasing too. This may prove unsustainable in the long term, forcing you to reduce your cover down in future as premiums get higher. It’s possible to increase your initial cover at a sustainable premium today, by setting your cover and premium increases to align to expected changes in your financial exposure over time;</li>\n<li>Secure your future insurability today. One of the biggest problems, says Malan, with policyholders adjusting their cover down in future is that they’re not only sacrificing the value of the premiums they’ve already paid for cover to retirement age (the policy is priced to retirement age from day one, so you pay for future increases from your very first premium) but also the loss of insurability. If your needs change in unexpected ways – for example, you find you have to work longer than you planned, setting your retirement back a few years – after you’ve reduced your cover, you may need to undergo underwriting again (medical tests to check your risk). If your health has deteriorated since you were first underwritten, you may pay much more for cover or find you can’t get the extra cover you need at all. There are products in the market – usually at an extra charge – that allow you to buy more cover at a later stage without having to undergo underwriting again. Malan cautions that some of these products do have limitations, such as limits to the kind of cover you may buy or specific timeframes when you may use this benefit. BrightRock offers various options to allow you to secure cover in future should your needs change, free of charge, on all its standard policies and without many of the restrictions that you may have with other insurers in the market.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff9900;\">BrightRock growth highlights</span></h3>\n<p>Since opening for business in April 2012 BrightRock has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Written future premiums of R1.2 billion in total, with cover in-force equating to around R81 billion</li>\n<li>Signed distribution contracts with more than 2 700 independent financial advisers nationwide</li>\n<li>Paid R17.5 million for a single death claim – its largest so far – for a policyholder who died of a gunshot wound</li>\n<li>Granted cover of R110 million to a single insured life and a single insured event on its largest life insurance policy</li>\n<li>Provided on average of 40% more coverage for the same premium rand for clients across the country.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>/ends</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff9900;\">About BrightRock</span></h3>\n<p>BrightRock was started with the goal of creating insurance products that truly meets consumers’ and financial advisers’ needs.

These products are perceived to provide greater certainty. The reason for this could be ascribed to the fact that most income protection policies lock in on benefit structures without meeting the policyholder&#8217;s individual needs, leading to a questionable value proposition. In addition to this, having capital in hand at claim stage provides more certainty and options and the claims definitions with income protection policies often include an aggregation against active income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An increasing amount of insurers are offering flexible income protection options, which may help increase the popularity of these products in the market. An example of this would be the fact that some insurers now offer income pay-outs for death benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Income protection policies pay a recurring income in the event of permanent disability or temporary disability, whereas lump-sum disability policies cover permanent disability through a once off lump sum pay-out. In our opinion, the main purpose of income protection products and lump-sum disability cover is essentially the same in the sense both products are aimed at protecting future income. The choice of product should suit the policyholder&#8217;s circumstances and needs at claim-stage, something which, in our opinion, is impossible to foresee at point of sale</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lump sum products are not always appropriate to the client&#8217;s actual needs. With a lump-sum, where a client is disabled without any impact on their life expectancy, they are at risk of outliving their income. Future changes in economic factors such as inflation, interest rates and investment returns could erode the value of the client&#8217;s cover by negatively impacting their ability to buy an annuity that matches their income needs. Lump-sum cover also typically contains significant premium waste, as the shape of the lump sum over time does not track the client&#8217;s need and income resulting in inevitable cover reviews, the reduction of cover that&#8217;s not needed later on in life, and premiums that have now been wasted paying for cover that&#8217;s never going to be in force at retirement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, where clients have a poor prognosis, if they had chosen an income protection product that pays out a monthly income amount they would receive far less value. A significant proportion of clients who are permanently disabled have a severely impaired life expectancy, meaning they would receive far fewer monthly income protection pay-outs. Other than BrightRock, providers of income protection products<br>never show the capitalised value of the recurring income they&#8217;re providing. And their clients are never offered the option to be paid the lump-sum instead. Nor can they offer clients this annuity rate on guaranteed terms at each point into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our opinion the current strict delineation between income-based and lump-sum-based disability cover is failing to fully meet client needs. That&#8217;s why we decided to offer clients, if they choose lump-sum cover for their permanent illness and injury needs, the ability to change this choice to a recurring pay-out at claim-stage. In other words, they only have to decide which option best suits them when they have an insight into how long they&#8217;re likely to live and what the current economic conditions are. For example, a client diagnosed with stage four cancer with a very poor prognosis who has not been given long to live may take the lump sum, while a client who loses a hand may opt for recurring pay-outs to retirement, growing at CPI+1% to replace lost income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where clients pick the lump-sum option, we automatically offer them the choice at claim-stage of a recurring pay-out on guaranteed terms, to protect them against the impact of longevity and future adverse market conditions and to give them significantly more pay-out value, through the best of both worlds choice. The option also exists to take a combination of the lump sum and recurring pay-outs to better meet your needs. In terms of tax-treatment, both structures are income tax neutral. In other words, should clients opt for the recurring pay-out at claim-stage, then no income tax will be deducted. So if a client&#8217;s income need is R30 000 and this is the monthly pay-out they&#8217;ve selected, then they will receive the full R30 000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that most income protection policies are designed to assist policyholders in the event of serious, unpredictable health events. Some income protection policies have different criteria based on the initial capital/ recurring selection, for example a client who is paralysed but goes back to work may receive their entire capital benefit pay out, but recurring pay-outs cease on returning to the workforce. In the market, the focus on occupational criteria and the practice of aggregation in claim of benefit payments against active income means that clients may have their pay-out reduced or halted even though they remain severely ill or injured and continue to meet the clinical criteria for a disabling illness or injury. This causes uncertainty for clients. BrightRock uses the same clinical definition set for permanent income and capital disability pay-outs and, once a claim is approved, we do not reassess or reduce pay-outs against any active income the client is able to earn despite their disability, which optimises certainty for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This article first appeared in Cover Magazine on 01 May 2020.

Here are three things you should look out for when considering taking out life insurance to protect your children in the future:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Education costs</strong><br>Education costs typically increase when a child goes from high school to university. Many insurance products don’t make provision for this, which leaves policyholders exposed. To protect against this risk, BrightRock offers the tertiary education step-up. It allows parents to provide for an automatic increase – of 50%, 100% or 200% – both in cover (pre-claim) and in pay-outs (post-claim) for the education needs of a specific child at the end of the year in which that child reaches the age of 18 years. This not only makes it possible for parents to provide for the expected increase in tuition fees but also for additional costs – for example, transport and accommodation at university. What makes this feature even more attractive is that the increase in cover is priced for from the first premium, which means that when it comes time for the cover to step up, you don’t get a nasty step up in your premium at the same time.<br><br><strong>2. Lump sum payout vs recurring payout</strong><br>This is a tough decision for parents to make, and it is impossible to see into the future and know what’s best. Certain life insurers like BrightRock don’t ask you to make that choice prematurely. You can structure your cover so that your children’s guardians can be given the choice between a lump-sum or recurring pay-out at the time of the claim, whichever structure will be best for your child. However, if you are worried that your child’s guardian won’t be responsible enough with a lump-sum pay-out, you can also choose to buy cover that only pays out as a recurring amount every month so that you can be sure that after your death the funds will be used to pay monthly school fees, and not all lost with one spin of the roulette wheel.<br><br><strong>3. Flexibility</strong><br>Insurance cover that’s flexible is definitely the best choice for you and your family. You want a policy that is tailormade to your needs and takes into account life’s unexpected surprises as well as the events that are anticipated. For example, with a BrightRock policy, when the childcare cover is no longer required, such as when the child becomes financially self-sufficient, you can convert childcare needs premiums to premiums for other needs. In addition, you can structure your cover to continue until the child reaches the specific age at which you expect them to be able to take care of themselves, not just until the age of 18 or 21 years. And with BrightRock, if your child gets accepted into that prestigious university that they’d be working hard to get into, you can use your extra cover buy-up to increase your cover without any medical underwriting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article first appeared on FA News on 30 April 2020 and is attributed to Schalk Malan, BrightRock CEO</em>.</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","fanews","group-risk"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"three tips getting life insurance that guarantees your children will have what they need when ’re gone brightrock ’s something parent ever wants think about – dying before their are yet old enough take care themselves just question who can trust look after them give all love need; also pay [&hellip;] good education want have holidays know they’ll love extra murals show such talent providing children’s needs should pass away prematurely one main reasons why parents out insurance here things considering taking protect future: 1 costs typically increase child goes from high school university many products don’t make provision this which leaves policyholders exposed against this risk offers tertiary step allows provide automatic 50% 100% 200% both cover (pre claim) pay outs (post claim) specific end year reaches age 18 years only makes possible expected tuition fees additional example transport accommodation feature even more attractive priced first premium means comes time step get nasty premium same time 2 lump sum payout vs recurring tough decision make impossible see into future what’s best certain insurers like ask choice prematurely structure guardians given between lump sum pay out claim whichever best child however worried child’s guardian won’t responsible with pay out choose buy pays amount every month sure death funds used monthly fees lost spin roulette wheel 3 flexibility that’s flexible definitely family policy tailormade takes account life’s unexpected surprises well events anticipated policy childcare longer required becomes financially self sufficient convert premiums other needs addition continue until expect able themselves 21 brightrock gets accepted prestigious university they’d working hard into use buy without any medical underwriting article appeared fa news 30 april 2020 attributed schalk malan ceo content staging fanews group risk"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":20574,"pull_quote":"\"A house is a big-ticket purchase that you’ll likely be paying off for years to come.

Policies offering these benefits have evolved and become more consumer-friendly, but you need to know what to look for to get the best benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ernest Zamisa, a financial planner at Momentum with 20 years&#8217; experience, says he has seen life assurers amend their life and risk products regularly over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An informed financial adviser can be invaluable to ensure you obtain the right assurance for your needs. You should expect your adviser to recommend a policy that meets your needs and that will pay out when you claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your adviser must also keep abreast of product changes and communicate the impact of such changes to you after you have taken out the cover, says Zamisa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cover for all your income</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are formally employed and &#8220;side-hustling&#8221; for extra income to make ends meet, you&#8217;ll want to cover these earnings too under your income protection policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kresantha Pillay, lead specialist for Lifestyle Protector at Liberty, says some people&#8217;s dependence on their side hustle is quite significant at almost a quarter of their overall income.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>&#8220;A good product will allow you to choose a lump sum or recurring income&nbsp; layout at claims stage,&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, Liberty has updated its income protection offering to cover two income streams under the same policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, policyholders with two occupations would have had to insure them separately, resulting in more paperwork and costs, she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify, your second income should be one you declare to the South African Revenue Service and should make up 20% or more of your annual income, she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zamisa says covering all your income is important, but to include your side hustle in a single policy may not be the best option, particularly if your second job is considered more risky than your main job. This could mean a higher aggregate premium for the total amount of income protection you require, he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schalk Malan, CEO of BrightRock, says a good income protection product will match your needs by offering a benefit that tracks the value of your remaining pay cheques. The benefit should provide you with a guaranteed income that allows you, at claims stage, to choose between income payments or a lump-sum payout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, this cover will start out fairly high and increase initially to match your increasing financial needs before it starts reducing as you near retirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insured for defined conditions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are able to do some kind of work, even in a lesser role, after suffering a disability, some policies will pay out only that part of your income you can no longer earn. However, newer policies include full income cover when you are diagnosed with certain listed conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan says policies that pay out based on a list of clinical conditions provide you with more certainty at claims stage. If you have a listed condition, you will receive a benefit once your condition has been established clinically and you won&#8217;t need to rely on the life company&#8217;s subjective assessment of whether you are able to perform your occupation or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Proving a claim</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, life assurers expect you to prove the loss of income you have suffered. The problem with this is that after an accident or falling ill, it will take some time for your bank statement to reflect a drop in your income, possibly a month or more, by which time your bills have piled up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A better option, according to Malan, is a policy that pays out on a sick note from your doctor, who sets out what is wrong with you. This will help later when you return to work and your income protection payments stop, as it might take some time to get your income back to the level where it was prior to your illness or injury, especially if your income is fee- or commission-based, he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Waiting periods</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All policies have waiting periods &#8211; an initial period during which you cannot claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You choose the waiting period when you take out your policy but there are minimum waiting periods that apply to certain occupations based on whether the insurer regards your job as risky. For instance, the industry typically applies a longer waiting period of up to six months for hairdressers and gym instructors, but seven days for surgeons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefit payout flexibility</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flexibility to choose how benefits are paid to you is another feature you will find on newer policies. A good risk cover product will offer you the ability to change your choice of a lump sum to a guaranteed recurring income payout (or any combination) at claims stage, when you know exactly what you need, says Malan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many insurers do not give you a choice of how you want your benefits to be paid out at claims stage and typically an income protection benefit is paid out monthly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to choose an upfront lump-sum payout is important if you are terminally ill, as you may not live long enough to receive many monthly payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Expiry of cover</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disability cover ends at your chosen retirement date, usually 65 years, but how the expiry date is defined is important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some insurers define the expiry date of your cover as the policy anniversary date before your 65th birthday, denying you up to a year of cover. Others may define the expiry date as being the end of the month in which you turn 65, or the policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malan warns that the way the expiry date is defined, combined with a waiting period, can effectively leave you without cover for up to two years before your retirement date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This article first appeared in BusinessLIVE, written by Charlene Steenkamp on 01 December 2019.

BrightRock has particularly seen advisers and clients embrace its permanent expenses cover, with more lump-sum disability cover being placed with BrightRock than with any other insurer, according to the recently-released Swiss Re Individual Volume Survey for 2018. In fact, the annual survey found that advisers placed more non-occupational disability cover with BrightRock in 2018 than with the rest of the market combined in the large segment (sum assured greater than R2,4 million). BrightRock is now also ranked second in terms of market share of the large segment, sold through advisers</p>\n<p>“While our temporary disability cover is already a market-leader, we believe the advancements we’ve introduced will make it the most comprehensive in the market. We hope to see it become the temporary disability cover of choice, similar to our permanent disability offering,” he said.</p>\n<p>Unpacking these improvements to its temporary disability offering in more detail, Malan said: “We’re always looking at ways in which we can improve our product to help advisers create needs-matched solutions for their clients. We believe that the advancements we’ve made to our temporary disability cover will help them provide their clients with temporary expenses cover that is flexible, provides clients with claims certainty and gives them more cover for their premiums.”</p>\n<p><strong>Additions to BrightRock’s temporary expense needs cover</strong></p>\n<p>The enhancements below are available both to new business and to existing policyholders (applied retrospectively) from November, ensuring all BrightRock clients have access to these features.</p>\n<p><strong>• Increased claims certainty with the most extensive list of clinical conditions covered in the market:</strong>&nbsp;All BrightRock clients with temporary disability cover now have access to the most comprehensive list of clinical definitions in the market, with over 300 conditions covered – each with a specified guaranteed pay-out. The list includes surgeries, fractures, hospitalisation, pregnancy and childbirth complications and more. For example, a client who has a one-month waiting period on their policy and claims from their temporary expenses cover for a hip replacement, will receive a guaranteed pay-out for three months.</p>\n<p><strong>• Claim-stage choice between a lump-sum or recurring pay-out – a market first:</strong>&nbsp;BrightRock is the first provider in the market to allow clients to choose the best pay-out option at claim stage, when they know what their actual needs are. In addition to this, BrightRock will also waive clients’ waiting periods if they choose the lump-sum option.</p>\n<p>“We introduced claim-stage choice under our permanent expenses cover, additional expense needs cover, and death cover when we launched our needs-matched product. It made sense to extend this flexibility, which allows clients to choose how they’d like to receive their pay-out – as recurring or stated lump-sum payment, or a combination of both – to our temporary disability cover, for guaranteed pay-outs under our clinical definitions,” says Malan.</p>\n<p><strong>• A one-month waiting period available for all occupations who qualify for temporary disability cover:</strong>&nbsp;Clients in manual occupations, such as animal breeders, massage therapists, hairdressers and personal trainers, will now have access to a one-month waiting period for a list of more than 300 clinical conditions. Before, these occupation groups would have had access to longer waiting periods of up to six months. This means that these clients can now have more claims certainty as they’d qualify for claims a lot sooner.</p>\n<p><strong>• Cover until stated cease date with dynamic waiting periods:</strong>&nbsp;Malan states that one of the biggest problems with temporary disability cover in the market is that clients’ cover doesn’t last as long as they expect it to. With some products in the market, clients’ cover will end on the policy anniversary before the client’s selected retirement age. This leaves clients exposed for up to a whole extra year as they approach retirement age.</p>\n<p>According to Malan, clients face even greater uncertainty and financial exposure with products with an extended waiting period – such as extended income protection products with a 24-month waiting period. Where the waiting period on a benefit is equal to or longer than the time left to the cover cease date – up to two years – clients won’t be able to claim from their income protection benefit, as it will come to an end before they can claim. This is despite the fact that clients are charged a premium during this waiting period, believing that they do have cover.</p>\n<p>“At BrightRock, our income protection cover behaves the way advisers and their clients expect it to. Our temporary and permanent expenses cover continues to at least when the client retires, as it ends on the policy anniversary after the client retires,” says Malan.</p>\n<p>The company has also included a new dynamic waiting period that is applied to their temporary expenses cover. This innovative approach means that the applicable waiting period will reduce down to the next shortest waiting period as clients near their chosen retirement age. For example, a client with a three-month waiting period will get a two-month waiting period if they claim in the third-last month of their policy. In their second-last month, they’ll have a month-one waiting period, and in the last month, they’ll have a seven-day waiting period. All BrightRock clients have a seven-day waiting period in their last month of cover.</p>\n<p>“BrightRock clients will always be able to claim on their temporary disability cover, no matter when they’re booked-off work,” Malan says.</p>\n<p><strong>• Proof of income not required at claim-stage:</strong>&nbsp;BrightRock doesn’t require proof of income at claim stage for claims under its clinical definitions if clients have already provided this proof at application stage. It also doesn’t require proof of income in the first six months of the claim for clients who’ve been booked-off work with a BrightRock Sick Note. “This provides our clients with even more certainty – it also reduces the administration hassle for them and their advisers,” Malan explains.</p>\n<p><strong>• Additional claims criteria with debt needs cover for retrenchment.</strong>&nbsp;BrightRock has also introduced a new debt instalment protector, which will pay up to 36 monthly payments, across multiple retrenchments. This new cover is available to clients who have taken out debt cover under their temporary expenses, permanent expenses and death cover (where the debt cover was ceded to a loan provider).</p>\n<p>In discussing the new product features, Malan also underlined the importance of financial advisers in delivering needs-matched solutions to clients. According to Malan, face-to-face advice is proven to be the best way to give clients the most cover for their premiums. The Swiss Re Individual Volume Survey for 2018, independent financial advisers and tied agents help clients get between 1,2 and 4,2 times more cover for their premiums, compared to all other distribution channels.</p>\n<p>“Our approach has always been geared towards supporting advisers’ best advice, allowing them to give their clients products that match their quality advice,” concludes Malan. “We believe these enhancements to our temporary expenses cover will equip advisers to offer clients temporary income protection that truly meets their needs – not just at the outset, but over their entire policy duration.”</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on FANews on 18 October 2019. <a href=\"https://www.fanews.co.za/article/company-news-results/1/brightrock/1361\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","disability-cover","income-protection","insurance","life-cover","life-insurance","schalk-malan","temporary-expense-needs"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"brightrock launches market first advancements its temporary disability cover needs matched life insurance provider brightrock announced enhancements expenses – changes that according ceo schalk malan hopes will significantly benefit policyholders filter through rest industry include: addition new conditions list clinical conditions;

This since entering the market only seven years ago, says BrightRock chief executive Schalk Malan.</p>\n<p>Malan said the prevailing economic conditions are challenging for businesses and in the life market there are some indications of slower growth and an increase in lapses because consumers’ pockets are under pressure.</p>\n<div id=\"ad-inarticle-middle\" data-google-query-id=\"CLKR_pnpoOYCFcYm4Aod1H8CTg\">\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/116466607/IOL/personal-finance/insurance/client-centric-approach-key-to-insurers-success-29746472_6__container__\">“However, where policyholders see the value of their life cover, they do tend to hold on to this important protection, even when times are tough. BrightRock offers clients a fundamentally different product design that precisely matches their needs and adapts to changes in their lives. It’s a client-centric approach that creates a unique solution for each and every client, and makes it clear what the value of their cover is,” said Malan.</div>\n</div>\n<p>He added that another important consideration in tough times is affordability, rather than simply choosing the cheapest premium.</p>\n<p>“However, clients tend to flock to providers that can offer them better value for their money. Brightrock’s needs-matched approach strips out unnecessary waste, offering clients an average of 40percent more cover for the same premium. We believe this has been a key driver in the strong growth we continue to see,” said Malan.</p>\n<div id=\"ad-leaderboard-inarticle\">&nbsp;He added that BrightRock has maintained its position as the fastest-growing life insurer in its market segment over the past number of years.</div>\n<p>“Last year, we achieved 43 percent growth in total premium income (as at December 31, 2018) and, contrary to the industry trend, our lapse experience has also been significantly better than expected. We expect this growth to continue and see BrightRock continuing to innovate and create products that meet clients’ needs. In terms of what this milestone means for us in the context of this tough economic climate, we feel it is a particularly important milestone, because BrightRock is delivering on our promises to clients and putting money in their pockets in difficult times when they need it most,” said Malan.</p>\n<p>The insurer has grown strongly since its market entry in 2012, and today covers more than 2 million lives across its individual life, life assistance and group risk offerings, while the latest available industry new business volume survey, published by SwissRe, placed BrightRock among the top four insurers in South Africa, with the majority of lump-sum disability business sold by independent advisers in the large premium market category placed with BrightRock.</p>\n<p>Malan said an example of the insurer meeting the needs of clients’ precisely and adapting to changes in their lives, throughout the duration of the policy and at the point of claim, is that BrightRock was the first insurer to offer clients the option of choosing an income-based payout for death claims or to offer them the ability to change their choice of a lump-sum payout to a regular monthly income amount.</p>\n<p>He said they can do this at claim stage, when families best understand how an illness or injury will affect their financial needs.</p>\n<p>“We are seeing the impact of these unique features not just in the strong take-up of our product among independent financial advisers, but in other significant metrics such as lower-than-expected lapse rates and, of course, in the nature and extent of the claims we pay,” he said.</p>\n<div id=\"teadsTarget\">&nbsp;Malan cites the removal of unnecessary barriers to claim as a key differentiator of the BrightRock approach; an example of this is removing 14-day survival periods for critical illness claims and general waiting periods for claims such as Parkinson’s disease, he said.</div>\n<p>According to BrightRock, another feature is that the insurer pays out on diagnosis whereas other insurers would require the client to wait a set period of time or for their condition to have deteriorated before claiming.</p>\n<p>The result is that in many instances, BrightRock pays out claims that competitors would not have paid, that the payout amount is larger than with other insurers, or that clients qualify to claim sooner than they would have with another provider.</p>\n<p>Malan added that another example is the patented Trauma IQ assessment, which pays for lower-severity accidental injuries that are typically not covered by other critical illness-products in the market.</p>\n<p>He said some of the features introduced by BrightRock, have since been adopted by competitors.</p>\n<p>Malan cites the examples mainly from BrightRock’s individual life product and its more recently-added group risk offering, launched last year, and sees the business expanding further into other markets and product categories in the medium to long term.</p>\n<p>In February, BrightRock introduced its tied agency force, BrightRock Financial Advisers.</p>\n<p>Malan said it’s an important step that would not only increase the insurer’s market share in its existing product categories, but provide a distribution foothold for future product additions to the BrightRock client offering.</p>\n<p>“We have always envisioned that our business would grow into a multi-product financial services institution of scale. With R1 billion in claims paid, we believe we have delivered unequivocal proof of concept for our needs-matched approach in one of the world’s growing and innovating markets, to continue finding better ways to meet clients’ financial needs throughout their lives and to continue changing our industry in the process.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on Personal Finance on 25 July 2019. <a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/personal-finance/insurance/client-centric-approach-key-to-insurers-success-29746472\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","client-centric","income-protection","insurance","life-cover","life-insurance","needs-matched","personal-finance","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"client centric approach key insurer&#8217;s success brightrock adapting different which precisely matches clients’ needs offers them 40 percent more cover same premium driver what elevated life insurer reach r1 billion mark claims this since entering market only seven years ago says chief executive schalk malan [&hellip;] malan said prevailing economic conditions are challenging businesses there some indications slower growth increase lapses because consumers’ pockets under pressure however where policyholders see value their cover they tend hold important protection even when times tough clients fundamentally different product design that adapts changes lives ’s creates unique solution each every client makes clear he added another consideration tough affordability rather than simply choosing cheapest premium flock providers can offer better money brightrock’s needs matched strips out unnecessary waste offering average 40percent believe been strong continue see &nbsp;he maintained its position fastest growing segment over past number years last year achieved 43 total income ( december 31 2018) contrary industry trend our lapse experience also significantly expected expect continuing innovate create products meet needs terms milestone means us context climate feel particularly milestone delivering promises putting money difficult need most grown strongly entry 2012 today covers 2 million lives across individual life assistance group risk offerings while latest available new business volume survey published by swissre placed among top four insurers south africa with majority lump sum disability sold independent advisers large category brightrock example meeting lives throughout duration policy point claim first option income based payout death claims ability change choice regular monthly amount claim stage families best understand how illness injury will affect financial seeing impact these features just take advisers other significant metrics such lower than expected rates course nature extent pay said &nbsp;malan cites removal barriers differentiator approach; removing 14 day survival periods critical general waiting parkinson’s disease according brightrock feature pays diagnosis whereas would require client wait set period time condition have deteriorated before claiming result many instances competitors paid amount larger insurers qualify sooner provider patented trauma iq assessment lower severity accidental injuries typically covered illness products market introduced adopted competitors examples mainly from recently added offering launched last sees expanding further into markets categories medium long term february tied agency force advisers step insurer’s share existing categories provide distribution foothold future additions offering always envisioned grow multi product services institution scale delivered unequivocal proof concept one world’s growing innovating markets finding ways changing process &nbsp; article originally personal finance 25 july 2019 click here read original online version content staging news income protection insurance life cover life insurance personal finance schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":22048,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":5744,"date":"23 Jul, 19","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Life assurance&#8217;s best-kept secret?","excerpt":"<p>When you leave your employer you lose your group life cover.

If you don&#8217;t get the same benefits from a new employer, it can leave a huge hole in essential cover you need to ensure you have an income if you are disabled or your family is provided for when you die.</p>\n<p>But there is a little-used option that maybe available: converting your group life cover into a policy in your own name. This is known as exercising the continuation option. Though the policy will<br />\nconvert into one that is priced for your age when you leave the group scheme, you won&#8217;t be underwritten. This means you don&#8217;t have to take any medical tests or answer any medical questionnaires and you won&#8217;t get any loadings on your premiums because you have medical conditions such as hypertension ordiabetes or, worse, have cover for these conditions excluded.</p>\n<p>The ability to get cover at the life company &#8216;s best rates for your age maybe one of the industry&#8217;s best-kept secrets. Few people take up the conversion option, assurers say. You may think you do not need it because you are moving to a new employer that also offers group life cover. But remember that most group life schemes offer you a standard amount of cover that may not be sufficient for your needs.</p>\n<p>Also, your current group life cover maybe a better product for example, offering a monthly income-protection benefit that will serve you better on disability than a lump sum, or cover for a disability that prevents you from doing your own occupation rather than only providing cover when you can&#8217;t do any similar occupation. Your employer if your group scheme is standalone or<br />\nyour retirement fund that offers &#8211; group benefits must have chosen to include the continuation option for your scheme, but Reinier van Gijsen, head of pricing at Sanlam Group Risk, says assurers typically do offer this option on all group risk cover except funeral cover.</p>\n<p>Hugh Hacking, the GM for operations at Old Mutual Corporate, says your employer or fund agrees to pay the premiums for this extra benefit and these amounts may in turn be deducted from your salary. The conversion option is mainly used by employees not in good health, as they know cover will either be declined or loaded if they have to apply for it with full underwriting. Van Gijsen says take-up is better among highly financially literate employees compared to lower-income earners. Low take-up rates don&#8217;t necessarily mean assurers are scoring. The additional premium for the conversion option takes into account an assumed level of the take-up as well as the claims employees exiting the group and taking individual policies tend to make, Hacking says. Van Gijsen says the group life division pays a conversion fee to the individual life division for it to convert the cover and accept you without underwriting.</p>\n<p>Schalk Malan, CEO of BrightRock, says if you are in poor health and therefore more likely to claim, the conversion option allows you to access cover you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be able to get or would have to pay more for in the market. Policyholders benefit the most from being able to convert their group risk cover to an &#8211; individual life policy even when take-up is low, he says. Simon Nicholson, head of product and analytics at Simply, says Simply does not charge an additional premium for giving employees the ability to convert to individual cover. The continuation benefit is typically priced the same as the standard life policy, so it only costs the insurer to guarantee you cover, even if you are in poor health. This is a risk the assurer is&nbsp;exposed to anyway through the group product, he says.</p>\n<p>Van Gijsen says the profile of the group changes very slowly, so the average rate does not change, but the premiums you pay as an individual may rise steeply depending on the a greed rate of increases for the premiums. For example, you may have an age-rated premium increase that results in your premiums rising more steeply with your age and not just in line with the inflation related increase in benefits. When you convert your group life cover, you may see a big jump in premiums, but you may still find the converted cover starting off at a lower rate than cover that is underwritten.</p>\n<p>Nicholson says the cover on conversion is guaranteed and there will be no exclusions, loadings or waiting periods unless you had these on additional cover you bought over and above the group cover offered without underwriting. You will typically only be denied a conversion if your scheme does not have such an option or if you joined the scheme less than a year before, Van Gijsen says.<br />\nHacking says after leaving your job, you typically have a period in which to convert for example, 60 days. You should be sent a policy document outlining all the benefits, terms and conditions and how future premium increases will be applied.

According to a recent international study, millennials make up 31.5% of the global population and Generation Z make up 32%.</p>\n<p>With those numbers, it would be foolish to overlook their generational characteristics and ignore their professional wants and needs. According Forbes<a href=\"https://www.insurancechat.co.za/2019-06/what-are-people-entering-the-job-market-looking-for/#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[i]</a>, their values are more practical than they are fun, so while companies that offer video games and free snacks to employees may get air time on social media, the ones that manage to truly meet their needs are the ones that really win.” But just what are those needs? What exactly are they looking for?</p>\n<p><strong>They expect employment benefits that match their values</strong></p>\n<p>It’s not surprising that the youth are looking for benefits that are closely matched to their changing needs. These would be benefits that can help them protect their income, sustain their future families and cover their financial exposure. But, amongst all other features valued by this generation, the one that stands out is flexibility. They’re looking for employee benefits that are flexible, but that also change as their careers change.</p>\n<p>According to the Deloitte Millennial Survey of 2018<a href=\"https://www.insurancechat.co.za/2019-06/what-are-people-entering-the-job-market-looking-for/#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[ii]</a>, what employees want most are benefits that offer them financial security and flexibility. According to the True South insurance gap study conducted in 2016, the average South African income earner has cover for less than 40% of their financial needs in the event of their death, with their group risk cover only covering about 15% of this need on average. Often employees wrongly assume that their group benefits are enough to ensure that have sustained financial security in the event of death, disability, or critical illness.</p>\n<p>If they only have group risk cover, they’re probably underinsured, and will not be able to protect their future pay cheques. Three or five or ten years of salary may sound like a lot, but if you still have more 20 working years left, how do you plan to cover the other 17, 15 or 10 years? Needs-matched insurers offer group cover that is customised to suit the needs of each employee.</p>\n<p><strong>The ability to prioritise family</strong></p>\n<p>It’s safe to say that a large amount of the people entering the job market are starting a family or are planning to. And they want a job that will allow them to order their priorities and schedules to allow for this. More importantly, employees need certainty that, should suffer a serious illness or injury, or death, their employer has comprehensive group risk cover to provide them and their loved ones with financial security. An advantage of insuring all employees together is that most employees will be covered without any medical underwriting.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, most traditional group cover products are standardised, commoditised and one-size-fits-all solutions that fail to meet employees’ and employers’ needs. This often leaves employees either over-insured at the point in their lives when they need the least insurance, or underinsured when they have the largest exposure.</p>\n<p>Employers should consider needs-matched cover that can better meet employees’ financial needs at these different ages, while securing the group 40% more cover on average for the same premium rand.</p>\n<p><strong>Surety for the future</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, as the research shows, employees are looking for flexibility and portability of their group risk benefits. With traditional group risk policies, employees often lose their cover when they leave an employer. However, more progressive and needs-matched insurers, allow employees to transfer their cover to a market-leading individual policy when they leave their employer – still without medical underwriting.</p>\n<p>A needs-matched group risk cover policy gives both employers and employees cost-efficient cover that truly meets their needs and provides greater certainty and flexibility – now and in the future. If fact, we would argue the greatest employee benefit is actually sound financial advice. Employers should not only consult with suitably qualified financial advisers in deciding on the best cover for their employees but should also encourage their employees to seek advice from a qualified financial planner who can look at their group risk and individual needs holistically and create a needs-matched financial plan that creates certainty and protection, and supports informed decision making on the part of the employee throughout their career.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.insurancechat.co.za/2019-06/what-are-people-entering-the-job-market-looking-for/#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\">[i]</a>&nbsp;5 Things We Know Millennials Want From A Job (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaytiezimmerman/2017/10/01/5-things-we-know-millennials-want-from-a-job/#1a7ccef67809\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaytiezimmerman/2017/10/01/5-things-we-know-millennials-want-from-a-job/#1a7ccef67809</a>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.insurancechat.co.za/2019-06/what-are-people-entering-the-job-market-looking-for/#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\">[ii]</a>&nbsp;The Deloitte Millennial Survey 2018 (<a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html\">https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html</a>)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on Insurance Chat on 26 June 2019. <a href=\"https://www.insurancechat.co.za/2019-06/what-are-people-entering-the-job-market-looking-for/\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","income-protection","insurance","insurance-chat","life-cover","life-insurance","millennials","needs-matched","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"what are people entering job market looking brightrock young today have high expectations even greater idealistic views when comes their employment decisions according recent international study millennials make 315% global population generation z 32% with those numbers would foolish overlook generational characteristics ignore professional [&hellip;] wants needs forbes [] values more practical than they fun while companies that offer video games free snacks employees may get air time social media ones manage truly meet needs really win just needs exactly expect benefits match ’s surprising youth closely matched changing these can help them protect income sustain future families cover financial exposure amongst all other features valued by this generation one stands out flexibility they’re employee flexible also change careers change deloitte millennial survey 2018 [ii] want most security true south insurance gap study conducted 2016 average african income earner less 40% event death group risk only covering about 15% need average often wrongly assume enough ensure sustained disability critical illness cover probably underinsured will able pay cheques three five ten years salary sound like lot still 20 working left how plan 17 15 10 years needs matched insurers customised suit each employee ability prioritise family safe say large amount starting planning allow order priorities schedules this importantly certainty that should suffer serious illness injury employer comprehensive provide loved security advantage insuring together covered without any medical underwriting unfortunately traditional products standardised commoditised one size fits all solutions fail employees’ employers’ leaves either over insured point lives least insurance underinsured largest employers consider better different ages securing same premium rand surety finally research shows flexibility portability benefits policies lose leave employer however progressive insurers transfer market leading individual policy – gives both cost efficient meets provides now future fact argue greatest benefit actually advice consult suitably qualified advisers deciding best encourage seek advice from planner who look holistically create creates protection supports informed decision making part throughout career &nbsp;5 things know ( https://wwwforbescom/sites/kaytiezimmerman/2017/10/01/5 things know millennials want from job/#1a7ccef67809 ) &nbsp;

It typically offers better protection against loss of income than a lump-sum disability cover, but you need to navigate some policy pitfalls.</p>\n<p>You need to make sure your insurer covers you for both temporary and permanent disability — many severe illnesses can put you off work for long periods, but because you are most likely to recover, you will not qualify for permanent disability benefits.</p>\n<p>You are much more likely to suffer a temporary disability than a permanent one, with statistics from life insurer FMI showing that seven out of 10 people will suffer a temporary disability in their lifetimes.</p>\n<p>But even with temporary disability cover, you could be out of pocket with a claim if a life assurer requires you to prove loss of income or if your insurer reduces the income it pays by the payments you receive for work you actually did in previous months, industry experts say.</p>\n<p>Schalk Malan, CEO at life company BrightRock, says there are two common practices in the life assurance industry that can delay or reduce the income you are expecting to receive when you claim under your income-protection policy.</p>\n<p>The first is the requirement that you prove your loss of income and the second is known in industry jargon as “aggregation against active income”. Aggregation against active income is the practice some insurers use to reduce the income you claim based on income you receive for work you carried out in the months before your illness or injury, he says.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"39323e6b-3560-4641-8e3c-e6d172b68a76\" class=\"article-widget article-widget-quote article-widget-float-left\">&nbsp;FMI CE Brad Toerien says if you are self-employed you should avoid a policy that will not pay if the period during which you are temporarily disabled does not coincide with your loss of income. If you are invoicing at month-end and being paid 30 days later, for example, you may be off work in May but could still earn income from work done in March or April, he adds.</div>\n<div id=\"03066c7f-9b84-4f07-902c-4753e2b36562\" class=\"article-widget article-widget-text\">\n<div class=\"wrap\">\n<div class=\"text\">\n<p>Malan says some insurers will only pay once your income has actually decreased or dropped to zero, and this provision, together with a waiting period (which you choose when you take out the policy) of, say, one month, means your claim will only be paid two to three months after you’ve been unable to work.</p>\n<p>The most comprehensive policies will pay on a sick note as well as on proof of diagnosis of one of a list of specified conditions for which a minimum payment is ensured. For example, a policy may guarantee two months’ worth of income commencing after the waiting period for a self-employed professional who has knee-reconstruction ligament surgery, Malan says.</p>\n<p>You should also ensure your income replacement policy covers you for partial disability as one in seven claims received by FMI in 2018&nbsp;were for claims for partial disability and these can be complex to assess, Toerien says.</p>\n<p>A partial disability claim is one you would make when you are able to perform some, but not all, of your normal duties. You might claim for a partial disability when you first fall ill, or when your health recovers to a point where you can gradually return to work.</p>\n<p>For partial disability claims, some insurers generally require you to prove either a loss of income or that you can only perform a percentage of your duties, while others give you the option of choosing between the two, giving you the ability to choose the one with highest possible payout, Toerien adds.</p>\n<p><b>What happens after your temporary cover ends?</b></p>\n<p>Most income protection policies will stop paying a temporary income benefit after 24 months, or the cover will reduce from 100% to 75% of your income.</p>\n<p>If you are still unable to work after 24 months, your income needs are unlikely to decrease and may actually increase due to the high cost of living with a disability, Toerien says.</p>\n<p>He adds that many temporary disabilities continue beyond 24 months — for example, a critical illness that requires intermittent treatment.</p>\n<p>A total of 1.8% of all claims to FMI in 2018 lasted longer than a year, but 40% of these claims were for disabilities that were not permanent, he says.</p>\n<p>Malan suggests you choose an insurer that provides you with cover equal to your full net income and where a permanent claim is triggered after a 24-month temporary claim.</p>\n<p>He says BrightRock defines permanent disability clinically as, for example, stage-four cancer, the loss of a hand, becoming blind or being declared unable to do your own occupation by an independent occupational therapist.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"67b4fff9-a6b2-48bb-b77a-01ca9a2ee1db\" class=\"article-widget article-widget-text\">\n<div class=\"wrap\">\n<div class=\"text\">\n<p><b>Ongoing cover</b></p>\n<p>Look for an insurer that does not require you to notify them of changes in jobs, smoker status or dangerous activities such as scuba diving or motocross in order to enjoy ongoing disability cover.</p>\n<p>Historically, insurers excluded benefits for injuries arising from dangerous activities or charged you more if you took up such activities after you took out your policy, but this is no longer the case with all insurers, Malan says.</p>\n<p>Temporary disability cover typically stops at retirement age, but some companies will allow you to move this cover to another benefit, such as critical illness or death cover without any medical tests, Malan says. The benefit is that you could later claim for events such as knee replacements, Parkinson’s disease or dementia.</p>\n<p>Many people are living longer and continue to work long after the traditional retirement age of 65. Make sure you can protect your income for as long as you expect to continue working. Some insurers offer temporary income protection up to the age of 75.</p>\n<p>Karen Bongers, product actuary at Sanlam Individual Life, says each insurer offers a different set of benefits and various optional add-ons are available on income benefit policies. She suggests you seek help from an accredited financial adviser.</p>\n<p>Your ability to earn an income is your greatest asset, so it is vital you take the time to ensure it is properly covered, she says.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>This article was originally published BusinessLIVE on 25 June 2019. <a href=\"https://www.businesslive.co.za/bt/money/2019-06-25-cover-yourself-properly-to-ensure-you-earn-even-while-ill/\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","business","businesslive","income-protection","life-cover","life-insurance","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"cover yourself properly ensure earn even while ill brightrock about seven out 10 people will suffer temporary disability their lifetimes income protection policy helps ease burden all policies are created equal being aware key features look can avoid disappointment financial shortfall claims stage [&hellip;] pays your income percentage when unable work typically offers better against loss than lump sum cover need navigate some pitfalls make sure insurer covers both permanent many severe illnesses put work long periods because most likely recover qualify benefits much more one with statistics from life fmi showing that lifetimes could pocket claim assurer requires prove reduces by payments receive actually did previous months industry experts say schalk malan ceo company brightrock says there two common practices assurance delay reduce expecting under income protection policy first requirement second known jargon aggregation active income aggregation practice insurers use based carried months before illness injury he says &nbsp;fmi ce brad toerien self employed should pay period during which temporarily disabled does coincide income invoicing month end paid 30 days later example may still done march april adds malan only once decreased dropped zero this provision together waiting (which choose take policy) say one month means three after ’ve been comprehensive sick note well proof diagnosis list specified conditions minimum payment ensured guarantee months’ worth commencing professional who knee reconstruction ligament surgery also replacement partial received 2018&nbsp;were these complex assess would able perform some all normal duties might fall ill health recovers point where gradually return claims generally require either duties others give option choosing between two giving ability highest possible payout what happens ends stop paying benefit 24 100% 75% needs unlikely decrease increase due high cost living disability adds disabilities continue beyond critical intermittent treatment total 18% 2018 lasted longer year 40% were permanent suggests provides equal full net triggered 24 month claim defines clinically stage four cancer hand becoming blind declared own occupation independent occupational therapist ongoing notify them changes jobs smoker status dangerous activities such scuba diving motocross order enjoy cover historically excluded benefits injuries arising charged took policy case insurers stops retirement age companies allow move another benefit death without any medical tests later events knee replacements parkinson’s disease dementia traditional age 65 protect expect working offer 75 karen bongers product actuary sanlam individual life each different set various optional add ons available policies she seek help accredited adviser greatest asset vital time covered &nbsp; article originally published businesslive 25 june 2019 click here read original online version content staging news business life cover life insurance schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":9015,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":5726,"date":"5 Jun, 19","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Bundling life insurance as newlyweds: Will you save?","excerpt":"<p>Getting married signals quite a few extra expenses, whether it be on the wedding party or furnishing a new home.

Therefore, you may be looking to save on costs such as your insurance. One such way is bundling your insurance. But is this the best option?</p>\n<p>Justmoney looks at bundling life insurance and how this affects both your premiums and your cover as a couple.</p>\n<p>“To bundle life insurance means that both spouses are insured on a single policy. It is usually called a joint life insurance policy,” says BrightRock chief executive officer, <strong>Schalk Malan</strong>. According to him, it used to be a common practice. However, as times change, so do insurance product offerings.</p>\n<p>“In the past there used to be a tax benefit attached to having a joint-life policy, but tax regulations have since changed and there is no longer such a benefit.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"h2\"><strong>Weighing up the pros and cons</strong></span></p>\n<p>The obvious benefits include having all your details saved under one “roof” which can save you time and effort when it comes to the administration and claims process.</p>\n<p>Another benefit is having both of you covered under a single premium instead of paying two monthly premiums. Your partner can also choose to add you to his or her own life insurance policy so that if one of you pass on, you are both covered.</p>\n<p>“Remember to check the exclusions that come with doing this as some insurers can only cover your partner within a certain time frame,” adds Malan.</p>\n<p>But according to him, it’s never a good idea to have a joint life policy. The same can be achieved by two policies that may offer even better protection for both spouses.</p>\n<p>“Money can be tight for newlyweds who are trying to build a home. In some scenarios bundling can help save newlyweds money, but it is possible that it could cost more. Bundling can come with the disadvantage of having insurance that doesn’t offer features that are vital for you. You could also end up paying more through bundling, when compared to mixing and matching various insurers,” says Craig Baker, chief executive officer of MiWayLife.</p>\n<p>Malan adds that another noteworthy disadvantage is that if a couple decides to separate or divorce and you are insured on a single joint life policy, you can’t divide the policy.</p>\n<p>“If one ex-partner decides not to pay his or her share of the premium, the policy will probably cease unless the other partner takes on the burden of paying the full amount. The partner who owns the policy can also decide to withhold policy pay-outs as well as change beneficiaries of the policy, without having the consent of their ex-partner. And as mentioned above, there are no tax benefits attached to these kinds of policies any longer.”</p>\n<p>Another problem is that with bundled policies the policy holder will have an influence on the amount of cover the spouse can purchase, as the policy holder effectively has control of the bundled insurance, and insurers may not be inclined to allow the spouse to add more cover.</p>\n<p>“Such an account might also not be too flexible as the bundled cover may need to have similar features. That’s why we would not recommend this structure,” Malan says.</p>\n<p><span class=\"h2\"><strong>Can bundling save you money?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Bundling does not save you as much money as consumers often expect. The only saving could be an insignificant saving on policy administration fees, says Malan.</p>\n<p>Baker adds that this will also differ according to each insurer.</p>\n<p>“Insurers that offer more than one type of insurance sometimes offer discounts to customers for choosing them to handle all of their policies. This could save couples anything between 10% &#8211; 30% on each premium. By bundling two or more policies an insurer could give you an incentive on discounting your insurance,” explains Baker.</p>\n<p><span class=\"h2\"><strong>How does bundling affect your cover or pay-out?</strong></span></p>\n<p>“Bundling your insurance will not lessen your cover, but it could affect your pay-out in some cases. If you are taking out a life insurance policy to the value of R1,5 million that is bundled with a R50,000 funeral cover, your funeral expenses can be deducted from the R1,5 million which means you will be paid a total of R1,450,000. Such factors need to be carefully considered when reading the exclusions, and terms and conditions that come with your policy,” says Baker.</p>\n<p>However, this will depend on the insurer and the cover choices you make.

But what about protecting our human capital from disability? Most people see life insurance as a no-brainer to protect themselves against losing their income due to death. But few people consider protecting their human capital in the event they become sick or injured, when we’re actually far more likely to become disabled in our working careers.<span id=\"more-35027\"></span></p>\n<p>When you’re in the early or middle stages of your career, there are few (if any) assets more valuable than your ability to earn an income. If you’re unsure whether you should have disability cover, consider the following questions:</p>\n<p><strong>Do you rely on a paycheque?</strong></p>\n<p>Most of us would most certainly answer this with a “yes”. And that reliance becomes even more pronounced if you’re married or have children because others likely depend on your contribution to the household.</p>\n<p>The need for disability cover will decrease as you approach retirement (and have fewer and fewer paycheques to protect). However, if you have children, the need for disability cover increases drastically, as their financial needs inevitably increase with age and comprise a larger proportion of where you direct your paycheques.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have everyday expenses?</strong></p>\n<p>Again, the majority of us can say that we do. And you may be thinking that just because you don’t do a dangerous job, such as one that requires a lot of travelling, you’re less prone to getting injured, and thus don’t require disability cover.</p>\n<p>But, 90% of long-term disabilities result from illness, rather than injuries, meaning that disabilities can occur – no matter what job you do. And if you don’t have disability cover, you risk not being able to cover your everyday expenses such as paying regular bills or keeping up with your larger financial plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have dependants?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>You probably do. And even if you don’t have dependants, you still need to be able to financially take care of yourself, in the event that you become disabled. Disabilities happen more often than you think, and it can have a negative impact on both you and your family.</p>\n<p>Take this year’s long Easter weekend for example – where most of us drove to spend time with our family (dependants) and friends – there were over 100 reported motor vehicle fatalities. And the people that were injured in car accidents would need their disability cover to help them and their families replace any loss of income.</p>\n<p><strong>What disability cover should you take out?</strong></p>\n<p>Now that you know how important disability cover is, you might be considering what disability cover to take out. With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brightrock.co.za/our-product/\">BrightRock</a>, you can have peace of mind knowing that you and your family will be protected in the event that you suffer a temporary or permanent disability. BrightRock’s needs-matched cover changes as your needs change. Because your cover meets your needs precisely, there’s no waste – so you’ll get 40% more cover for every premium rand. They don’t do aggregation against active income for permanent or temporary disability claims (so if you’re still able to earn an income once your claim has been approved despite your disability, BrightRock won’t reduce your pay-out), and you can decide exactly how much cover you want, for the most appropriate amount of time.</p>\n<p>Accidents can happen anywhere, at any time – and illness can strike anyone. Don’t leave a gaping hole in your otherwise comprehensive financial picture. Use this as the nudge you may need to stop procrastinating and start protecting your most important asset.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on Money Marketing on 28 May 2019. <a href=\"https://www.moneymarketing.co.za/why-is-having-disability-cover-important/\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","disability-cover","income-protection","insurance","money-marketing","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"why having disability cover important brightrock when ’re expecting our first child quick put life insurance policies place what about protecting human capital from disability most people see brainer protect themselves against losing their income due death few consider event they become [&hellip;] sick injured actually far more likely disabled working careers ’re early middle stages your career there are ( any) assets valuable than ability earn income unsure whether should have cover following questions: rely paycheque us would certainly answer this with yes that reliance becomes even pronounced married children because others depend contribution household need will decrease approach retirement ( fewer paycheques protect) however children increases drastically financial needs inevitably increase age comprise larger proportion where direct paycheques everyday expenses again majority can say may thinking just don’t dangerous job such one requires lot travelling less prone getting thus require cover 90% long term disabilities result illness rather injuries meaning occur – matter job risk being able expenses paying regular bills keeping plan dependants &nbsp; probably dependants still financially take care yourself disabled happen often think negative impact both family year’s long easter weekend example drove spend time family (dependants) friends were over 100 reported motor vehicle fatalities injured car accidents help them families replace any loss out now know how important might considering out with&nbsp; peace mind knowing protected suffer temporary permanent disability brightrock’s needs matched changes change meets precisely there’s waste ’ll get 40% every premium rand aggregation active claims ( once claim been approved despite disability won’t reduce pay out) decide exactly much want appropriate amount time anywhere illness strike anyone leave gaping hole otherwise comprehensive picture use nudge stop procrastinating start asset article originally published money marketing 28 2019 click here read original online version content staging news disability cover income protection money marketing schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":12393,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":5705,"date":"27 May, 19","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Marriage is an emotional and financial package deal","excerpt":"<p>Five key financial matters you need to consider before flying off on your honeymoon MARRIAGE is not only about taking care of each other&#8217;s emotional well-being, but also your mutual financial well-being.

So while you&#8217;re planning a lifetime partnership with your loved<br />\none, here are five financial questions to ask once you&#8217;ve popped the question:</p>\n<p><strong>What are our financial needs and responsibilities?</strong><br />\nAs depressing as it may be, it&#8217;s important to discuss what would happen if you or your spouse were to suffer a debilitating illness, injury or death. Most young couples don&#8217;t have many financial assets,so at this stage of your lives, life insurance will probably need to focus on protecting your income-related needs. It&#8217;s there to ensure you can afford your debt, everyday expenses, and healthcare costs if something should happen to either of you. This could include paying off your car finance or the mortgage bond on a new house and arbitrary debts, such as the credit card debt you may have notched up to pay for the honeymoon. A qualified financial adviser will be able to help you choose the best cover. And remember while you typically only need to protect your income<br />\nuntil retirement, there are some basic household expenses and health care costs that will be there for life. So you&#8217;ll need to take in to account how much provision you&#8217;ve made for retirement when looking at your life and disability cover needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Are our life cover policies flexible?</strong></p>\n<p>As newlyweds, you may be expecting even more change moments later in your life together, particularly if you&#8217;re planning to start a family someday. Although the number of pay cheques you&#8217;ll need to protect will never be higher than they are today, you may want the flexibility to increase the monthly cover, as your pay cheques will hopefully take big increases later. But as you grow older, changes in your health and lifestyle may make it more difficult to get the cover you need. Later in life, insurers may charge you more &#8211; or even decline certain cover &#8211; as your risk increases with age. The life insurance policy you take out today therefore also needs to offer you future insurability, making it easier to change or increase your cover when your needs and circumstances change.</p>\n<p><strong>How can we ensure an 3 affordable policy will still give excellent cover? </strong></p>\n<p>Affordability is usually a big concern. With most couples today having to pay for their own weddings and carrying the costs of setting up house together, getting married can put huge financial strain on the budget. As tempting as it may be to opt for the cheapest premium, it&#8217;s important to make sure that you do not structure your policy at the expense of future sustainability.<br />\nMost life insurance policies start off with a lower premium &#8211; and lower cover &#8211; at the start, but then start to increase your premiums and cover with time. However, your financial liabilities are generally at their highest earlier in life when you have more future pay cheques to protect, and more debts to pay off. Needs-matched policies exist in the market that can be structured sustainably to offer you more cover upfront when you need it, and reduce over time when you have fewer financial obligations. These policies are also more flexible than traditional products, making it easier for you to increase your cover for certain needs later in life &#8211; such as critical illness cover and healthcare expenses- by using the premiums for cover (for income, debt and child-related expenses) you no longer need.</p>\n<p><strong>What about dread disease cover? </strong></p>\n<p>While protecting your income will ensure you are able to afford your day-to-day expenses and pay off your debts if something were to happen, this cover won&#8217;t make provision for unforeseen expenses that may arise if one of you were to become injured or ill. Dread disease or critical illness cover can help you make provision for any additional expense needs that may arise from serious illnesses or injuries like the cost of lifestyle adjustments or shortfalls in medical aid payouts. Again, your financial adviser will be able to guide you on the appropriate level of cover for these needs,<br />\ntaking into account the extent of your medical cover and your affordability concerns. Be sure you sign up for a product that includes cover injuries and traumatic events too.</p>\n<p><strong>Should my spouse be my sole beneficiary? </strong></p>\n<p>Listing your spouse as a sole beneficiary of your life insurance policy may not be as considerate as you think. Many young couples not only take care of each other, but also have parents or siblings<br />\nto support. Ensuring that you&#8217;ve thought about these other dependants in setting up your beneficiaries will prevent complications in the event where both you and your spouse die simultaneously,<br />\nand also simplify matte.</p>\n<p><em>This&nbsp;</em><em>article was </em><em>originally published in the Cape Argus on 21 May 2019.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","budget","child-expenses","childcare-needs","expenses","income-protection","insurance","life-cover","life-insurance","marriage"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"marriage emotional financial package deal brightrock five key matters need consider before flying your honeymoon only about taking care each other&#8217;s well being also mutual well being while &#8217;re planning lifetime partnership with loved one here are questions ask once &#8217;ve popped question: [&hellip;] one what our needs responsibilities depressing may &#8217;s important discuss would happen spouse were suffer debilitating illness injury death most young couples don&#8217;t have many assets this stage lives life insurance will probably focus protecting income related needs there ensure can afford debt everyday expenses healthcare costs something should either could include paying car finance mortgage bond new house arbitrary debts such credit card debt notched pay honeymoon qualified adviser able help choose best cover remember typically protect income until retirement some basic household expenses health that life &#8217;ll take account how much provision made retirement when looking disability cover policies flexible newlyweds expecting even more change moments later together particularly start family someday although number cheques never higher than they today want flexibility increase monthly cover hopefully big increases later grow older changes lifestyle make difficult get need life insurers charge &#8211; decline certain risk age policy out today therefore offer future insurability making easier circumstances change 3 affordable still give excellent cover affordability usually concern having their own weddings carrying setting getting married put huge strain budget tempting opt cheapest premium sure structure expense sustainability most lower premium start then premiums time however liabilities generally highest earlier protect debts needs matched exist market structured sustainably upfront reduce over time fewer obligations these flexible traditional products critical illness expenses by using ( income child related expenses) longer dread disease day day happen won&#8217;t unforeseen arise one become injured ill any additional from serious illnesses injuries like cost adjustments shortfalls medical aid payouts again guide appropriate level needs taking into extent concerns sign product includes traumatic events too sole beneficiary listing beneficiary considerate think other parents siblings support ensuring thought other dependants beneficiaries prevent complications event where both die simultaneously simplify matte this&nbsp; article originally published cape argus 21 2019 content staging news budget child expenses childcare needs income protection life cover life insurance"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":17667,"pull_quote":"“Your comfort zone may be comfortable, but it’s no place for growth or change...\"","type":["expert"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":5699,"date":"20 May, 19","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Loss of income is dangerously underestimated","excerpt":"<p>You are nine times more likely to have a temporary disability than to have your car stolen or hijacked in SA, Brad Toerien, CE of life insurer FMI says.

Yet, income protection remains dangerously undersold, Toerien says.</p>\n<p>Seven out of 10 people will experience at least one injury or illness during their working lives that will prevent them from being able to earn their income, according to figures released this week by FMI, a life assurer in the Bidvest group in its annual claims presentation for the 2018 period.</p>\n<p>The risk of illness or injury for a temporary period is significantly greater than the risk of dying, becoming permanently disabled or contracting a critical illness and is therefore the risk we should all be most worried about, Toerien says.</p>\n<p>Alarmingly for the self-employed, your risk of a temporary disability from illness or injury that will stop you from working for at least two weeks is exponentially higher than the risk of permanent disability or critical illness at every age.</p>\n<p>FMI&#8217;s statistics show that the chance of a 25-year-old being temporarily disabled some time during their working career is 92%, that of a 32-year-old 91%, of a 50-year-old 81% and of a 62-year-old 57%.</p>\n<p>And if you think you are OK because you work for a company and your sick leave can easily cover you for a temporary illness or injury, think again.</p>\n<p>According to FMI&#8217;s statistics, the average number of days off work for a claim for accidents is 66 days and for illnesses and medical procedures is 52 days.</p>\n<p>You may already have used up a substantial part of your sick leave and be left with only a few days at a time when you need it most, adds Karen Bongers, product actuary at Sanlam Individual Life.</p>\n<p>Toerien says it can take more than a year to qualify for a permanent disability claim, but if you&#8217;re unable to work for an extended period before your claim is approved this could have serious financial consequences.</p>\n<p>An income protection policy that pays out after a short waiting period is the smart way to protect yourself from this potential financial disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>The risks of self-insuring</strong></p>\n<p>People don&#8217;t properly consider what will happen if they cannot work for a period of time. In the back of their minds they may think they will use their savings, or that their spouse will still be earning an income, says Bongers. However, most families rely on two incomes and the loss of one income will impact the family finances.</p>\n<p>If your savings are earmarked for a goal such as your children&#8217;s education or your retirement, you need those savings to meet those goals and not to dip into it for monthly expenses if you are unable to work. The longer you are unable to work, the greater the chance that your savings will simply run out, Bongers says.</p>\n<p>Toerien says your savings may not extend to covering a second or third time when you cannot earn an income. FMI statistics show that multiple claims are common. You are three times more likely to claim again after your first claim.</p>\n<p>Some employees rely on the group benefits available through their employer.</p>\n<p>But, Toerien says, most group benefits do not have a temporary income benefit and if they do, they have a 90-day waiting period. FMI&#8217;s statistics show that 88% of claims were for periods of less than 90 days during which the policyholder could not work.</p>\n<p>BrightRock CE Schalk Malan says it&#8217;s easy to calculate how much income protection you require by adding up your monthly bills such as rent, water and electricity, loan repayments, transport, food bill and children&#8217;s school fees in a monthly budget.</p>\n<p>Toerien says three forms of risk cover are touted by the life insurance industry: disability, dread disease and death cover, but he believes you should consider long-term and temporary disability as separate benefits.</p>\n<p>FMI strongly recommends that you protect your income first and then only consider how much lump-sum disability cover you need. Income protection cover is typically 20% to 25% cheaper than the equivalent lump-sum disability cover, Toerien says.</p>\n<p>FMI has calculated that the premium saving you can make on an income protection policy over your working life from age 35 to 65 at a salary of R40,000 a month, could amount to more than twice your annual salary at retirement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This&nbsp;</em><em>article was written&nbsp;</em><em>by Charlene Steenkamp and&nbsp;</em><em>originally published in the Sunday Times on 19 May 2019.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","budget","expenses","growth","income-protection","personal-finance","schalk-malan","underwriting"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"loss income dangerously underestimated brightrock are nine times more likely have temporary disability than your car stolen hijacked sa brad toerien ce life insurer fmi says most people don&#8217;t think twice about insuring their car few consider protecting that makes paying possible he costs [&hellip;] r900 month insure 2018 vw polo only r480 protection 35 year old non smoking woman who earns r40000 month put into perspective this scenario cost valued around r250000 double her monthly securing future earnings even surprising when earning will earn r43m during working career 65 yet remains undersold toerien seven out 10 experience least one injury illness lives prevent them from being able income according figures released week by fmi assurer bidvest group its annual claims presentation period risk period significantly greater dying becoming permanently disabled contracting critical therefore should all worried about alarmingly self employed stop two weeks exponentially higher permanent every age fmi&#8217;s statistics show chance 25 year old temporarily some time 92% 32 year old 91% 50 year old 81% 62 year old 57% ok because work company sick leave can easily cover injury again statistics average number days claim accidents 66 illnesses medical procedures 52 days may already used substantial part left with need most adds karen bongers product actuary sanlam individual life says take year qualify claim &#8217;re unable extended before approved could serious financial consequences policy pays after short waiting smart way protect yourself potential disaster risks self insuring properly what happen they cannot time back minds use savings spouse still bongers however families rely incomes impact family finances savings earmarked goal such children&#8217;s education retirement those meet goals dip expenses work longer work simply run out bongers extend covering second third income multiple common three again first claim employees benefits available through employer says benefit 90 day 88% were periods less 90 which policyholder schalk malan &#8217;s easy calculate how much require adding bills rent water electricity loan repayments transport food bill school fees budget forms touted insurance industry: disability dread disease death cover believes long term separate benefits strongly recommends then lump sum need typically 20% 25% cheaper equivalent calculated premium saving make over age 35 65 salary month amount retirement &nbsp; this&nbsp; article written&nbsp; charlene steenkamp &nbsp; originally published sunday 19 2019 content staging news budget growth income protection personal finance schalk malan underwriting"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":19461,"pull_quote":"","type":["expert"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":22047,"date":"12 May, 19","author":"BrightRock","heading":"It&#8217;s your funeral, so weigh these factors well","excerpt":"<p>We unpack the many considerations when buying this insurance Funeral insurance is the most popular financial product in SA and there is lots of competition for your business, but it isn’t easy to compare policies to ensure you are getting a fair deal.

This is because benefits, conditions, value-adds and how your premiums increase — all of which influence the premium you pay — differ from policy to policy.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">You can’t just focus on premiums alone, because though one insurer may be cheaper, for a few rands more another insurer could be offering you a lot more value, says Adriaan Bester, general manager of corporate affairs at Avbob.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">The most obvious things that affect the cost of your cover are the insured amount and other benefits you will get if you claim, the number of people you want covered on your policy, your age and the age of family members you insure.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">There are also some less obvious factors that influence premiums. Here are some key things you may not know:</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\"><strong>A few questions</strong></p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Most funeral cover is sold without underwriting, so you don’t have to answer lots of questions about your health or go for medical tests.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">But you can get significantly cheaper funeral cover that is underwritten — for example, as an additional benefit on a life policy.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">A quote from Old Mutual shows that a healthy single 39-year-old man will pay R91 a month for R20,000 of funeral cover on the insurer’s most basic non-underwritten funeral policy, and just R36 a month for the same cover on the Greenlight Final Expenses policy if he answer questions about his health and lifestyle and possibly undergoes some medical tests.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">For R50,000 of cover the difference is even more marked — R208 for non-underwritten versus R54 for underwritten.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">If you want to provide for your family after your death, using funeral cover to do so is expensive. You may have to jump more hurdles to take out life cover and it might take longer to pay out after your death, but your premiums will typically buy more cover for your family than a funeral policy will provide.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\"><strong>A group policy can save you lots</strong></p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">If you are offered funeral cover as a group benefit, it is likely to save you in premiums.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Andrew Codd, divisional director of emerging consumer market products at Liberty, says premiums can be anything from 25% to 50% cheaper, and Lee Bromfield, CEO at FNB Life, estimates they will be about 30% cheaper.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Berniece Hieckmann, head of product and client solutions at Metropolitan, says as group cover is typically compulsory for all the members of the group, the insurer will cover both the healthy and unhealthy lives.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Individual policies are more likely to be taken out by people who are or have family members who are unhealthy or older and are more likely to submit claims early.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">The insurer will need to charge higher premiums to fund these claims, says Hiekmann.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Felix Kagura, head of life assurance at Standard Bank, says it is easier for an insurer to estimate the risks it faces in a restricted group. Typically, a group funeral policy covers you and your immediate family only, not your extended family.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Hieckmann says group policies cover you only until you leave the group — for example, when you retire or cancel your bank account, your cover ends. Therefore, most policyholders pay premiums and never claim and the insurer can use the money to charge lower premiums, she says.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Codd and Bester say group policies are repriced annually based on the claims experience and the average age and living standards of the employees covered, but individual policy premiums and increases are set at the start of the policy. Individual policy premiums are based on age, which means they may be cheaper than group policies when you are younger, but more expensive when you are older.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Insurers also say group policies are cheaper to administer, the commissions brokers earn are lower and there is less advice.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\"><strong>Premium patterns affect price</strong></p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Don’t only compare the starting premium you are quoted, but ask how premiums may increase in future, says Codd. He suggests you ask what the premium will cost in five years’ time.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Bromfield says two insurers may offer you the same cover and the same premium, but one may increase premiums by 10% annually, while the other increases by 5% annually, or one increases the cover amount annually and the other does not.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Initially they look the same but eventually you may pay for more or be covered for less in real (after inflation) terms depending on which product you choose.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Some policies’ premiums increase at higher rates each year as you age, so premiums may start low but have high annual increases, says Codd.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">To make things more complicated, the insured benefit you will get if you claim may increase each year at a different rate to your premiums. For example, the benefit may increase at 6% but the premium will increase by 10%. In terms of policyholder protection rules, providers must give you information about increases when you take out the policy.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\"><strong>Cash-back bonuses</strong></p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Funeral insurers want you to keep paying your premiums, so they offer cash-back bonuses if your policy is still active after a certain period.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Liberty, for example, offers to pay you back five premiums if your policy is still in place after five years, regardless of whether you claimed or not, says Codd.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Remember, the cost of this benefit is built into the premium and it is only worth your while if you keep the policy going.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Consider how much the cashback benefit is and from when you qualify for it, says Bester.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Hieckmann says cash-backs can be very tempting but these and other value-added benefits often have very little to do with your need to cover the funeral you want.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Peter Castleden, the CEO of Indie, a new online insurer backed by Sanlam, says Indie’s funeral policy rewards those who maintain their cover by doubling the insured amount after two years. Castleden expects this will result in more healthy people buying Indie’s product, which will reduce claims and ultimately premiums.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\"><strong>The online insurer</strong></p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Newer funeral insurers sell policies online only, giving them lower distribution costs than those with branches and brokers, says Kagura.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Mutual insurers, such as Avbob, do not have shareholders. All policyholders become members and receive a share of profits in the form of special bonuses, which can be converted to premium holidays.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\"><strong>Period for which you’re covered</strong></p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Hieckmann says you should consider whether the policy covers you for your lifetime, or whether it is a limited-term policy. If it is for a limited term, the premium should be lower because your cover will end if you survive the term.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">At that stage you will have to start over by buying a new policy, which is likely to be much more expensive because you will be older, she says.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Some insurers offer you cover for the whole of your life, but stop charging you premiums at age 65 or 85. This could be a valuable benefit when you are older and living on a low pension but it will mean a higher premium when you are younger.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">You can’t just focus on premiums alone when choosing a policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Check on funeral parlours offerings</strong></p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Many funeral parlours are distributors of funeral insurance. There have been some bad cases of unregistered parlours selling insurance where there was no underwriter and/or poor services. Check that both the parlour and the insurer are registered. Any policy you take out, even if it offers services from a particular parlour, should also offer a cash benefit.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">BrightRock has partnered with selected funeral parlours and is underwriting insurance for them on a group basis. Schalk Malan, a director of BrightRock, says insurance sold through parlours is often perceived as being more expensive, but the benefits parlours offer may be very valuable for some people.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">Many funeral parlours collect and transport bodies from remote areas at all hours and offer counselling and administrative support to bereaved families. Felix Kagura, head of life assurance at Standard Bank, says though parlours can manage their costs well, an insurer with a big book can also reduce costs.</p>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\">\n</div>\n<p data-bind=\"text: $data\"><em>This&nbsp;</em><em>article was written&nbsp;</em><em>by Laura Du Preez and&nbsp;</em><em>originally published in the Sunday Times on 12 May 2019.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","business","funeral","funeral-assistance","funeral-parlours","insurance","leopold-malan","schalk-malan","underwriting"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"&#8217;s your funeral weigh these factors well brightrock unpack many considerations when buying this insurance funeral most popular financial product sa there lots competition business isn’t easy compare policies ensure are getting fair deal ask number providers quotes will find [&hellip;] prices vary wildly because benefits conditions value adds how premiums increase all which influence premium pay differ from policy policy can’t just focus alone though one insurer may cheaper few rands more another could offering lot value says adriaan bester general manager corporate affairs avbob obvious things that affect cost cover insured amount other benefits get claim people want covered policy age family members insure also some less premiums here key know: questions sold without underwriting don’t have answer about health go medical tests can significantly cheaper underwritten example additional benefit life quote old mutual shows healthy single 39 year old man r91 month r20000 insurer’s basic non underwritten r36 same greenlight final expenses he his lifestyle possibly undergoes r50000 difference even marked r208 versus r54 underwritten provide after death using expensive jump hurdles take out might longer typically buy than provide group save offered benefit likely andrew codd divisional director emerging consumer market products liberty anything 25% 50% lee bromfield ceo fnb life estimates they 30% cheaper berniece hieckmann head client solutions metropolitan compulsory group both unhealthy lives individual taken by who older submit claims early need charge higher fund claims hiekmann felix kagura assurance standard bank easier estimate risks faces restricted group typically covers immediate only extended family hieckmann only until leave retire cancel bank account ends therefore policyholders never claim use money lower premiums she says codd bester say repriced annually based experience average living standards employees covered increases set start age means younger expensive older insurers administer commissions brokers earn advice patterns price starting quoted future codd suggests what five years’ time bromfield two offer premium 10% annually while 5% does initially look eventually real (after inflation) terms depending choose policies’ rates each year low high annual increases make complicated different rate 6% 10% policyholder protection rules must give information cash back bonuses keep paying still active certain period offers back place years regardless whether claimed remember built into worth going consider much cashback qualify bester cash backs very tempting value added often little with want peter castleden indie new online backed sanlam indie’s rewards those maintain their doubling years castleden expects result product reduce ultimately newer sell giving them distribution costs branches brokers kagura insurers such avbob shareholders become receive share profits form special bonuses converted holidays period ’re should lifetime limited term limited term end survive term stage over older whole stop charging 65 85 valuable pension mean younger alone choosing check parlours offerings distributors insurance been bad cases unregistered selling where underwriter / poor services parlour registered any out services particular parlour cash benefit partnered selected underwriting basis schalk malan brightrock through perceived being expensive people collect transport bodies remote areas hours counselling administrative support bereaved families manage well big book costs this&nbsp;

Its total premium income was up 43% in 2018, at a time when its parent company, Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF), saw a modest 4% increase in business volumes.</p>\n<p>And BrightRock is no longer a small player: last year it had annual premium income of R1.6bn and new business of R433m. It now has a 12% market share of large-risk policies sold by independent financial advisers (IFAs), making it the fourth-largest player.</p>\n<p>Average monthly premiums are R1,400, but there is no minimum if the client has a need for only modest cover.</p>\n<p>BrightRock is currently writing half of all lump-sum disability policies.</p>\n<p>BrightRock products are distributed by 4,400 IFAs. It takes what is called a needs-based approach which is too complex to manage on the back of a cigarette box. There are in effect six separate mini-policies to cover household needs, debt, childcare needs, death-related costs (such as estate duty), health-care costs and unexpected costs.</p>\n<p>When the cover is no longer for debt or for children, premiums can be reweighted to take care of expected increases in the costs of the other benefits. When the need for cover has fallen overall, premium increases can be curbed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have found that clients have switched to BrightRock after getting a 20% premium increase from a competitor,&#8221; says CEO Schalk Malan.</p>\n<p>He says the needs-based approach does not just apply to individual life, death and critical illness policies. It has already expanded in the highly commoditised group risk market.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And logically one day we will address one of the most important needs, which is savings. Then we would handle both sides of the personal balance sheet.&#8221; Jurie Strydom, CEO of SPF, says the group was attracted by BrightRock’s innovative approach and fast growth.</p>\n<p>It liked the founder-managed culture and it has no intention of integrating the business operations. BrightRock owes its success to date to the four founders, all Discovery-trained, each with their own area of expertise. The four are: Malan, an actuary with extensive product development experience; Sean Hanlon, the sales and distribution tsar; Leopold Malan, the data processing guru; and Suzanne Stevens, who heads marketing and communications.</p>\n<p>Many people’s first encounter with the BrightRock brand is on the shirts of the Stormers and Western Province rugby teams. It is also a good recruiting tool as Cape Town has more actuaries per head than anywhere else in SA. But BrightRock has not introduced a loyalty programme along the lines of Vitality or Multiply. Malan says life insurance is about providing a precise sum for an agreed premium. This sum should not depend on reaching sapphire status.</p>\n<p>Strydom says BrightRock is distinct from Sanlam’s main in-house innovation hub, Indie, which is going for a direct market.</p>\n<p>But in turn Indie will have more bells and whistles, such as a savings component, than the vanilla price-driven MiWay Life, also in the Sanlam empire.</p>\n<p>Sanlam bought control of BrightRock from Lombard Life. Lombard is one of the vehicles used by the Enthoven family to invest in start-up insurers.</p>\n<p>The Enthovens have incubated some highly successful insurers such as Hollard and Telesure, which owns Auto &amp; General and Dialdirect. Malan says that BrightRock, even as an intermediated business, is a child of the digital era: even 10 years ago it would have been impossible to manage a product set as complex as it is now, with the technology of the day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We would argue that with the growing flood of information, advice is more important than ever,&#8221; Malan says.</p>\n<p>BrightRock has not yet seen a direct imitation of its needs-based approach but it is slowly changing some industry practices. BrightRock got rid of the survival period, which had meant that anyone who died within 14 days of a traumatic event was not paid disability cover. Momentum has now followed suit.</p>\n<p>BrightRock came into the group risk market last May and it signed on 50 schemes, none of them whales.</p>\n<p>But it would have still been a small contributor to premium flow. As part of the needs-based approach, instead of giving a fixed four times salary it looks at the number of pay cheques left in the member’s career. It has enabled it to offer 40% more cover per premium on average, though older members could see a significant cut in benefits.</p>\n<p>BrightRock’s licence is made available to funeral parlours to offer assistance products such as funeral policies.</p>\n<p>Malan says this allows BrightRock to deploy its technology into the area, though he admits it has little expertise in the market and is unlikely to focus there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This&nbsp;</em><em>article was written&nbsp;</em><em>by Stephen Cranston and&nbsp;</em><em>originally published in the Financial Mail on 02 May 2019.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","dhl-stormers","financial-mail","insurance","leopold-malan","life-cover","life-insurance","s","schalk-malan","sean-hanlon"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"brightrock shows way innovation longer small player: last year had annual premium income r16bn new business r433m time when insurtech businesses are cutting out middleman brightrock just seven years old stands poster child traditional intermediary based model its total 43% [&hellip;] 2018 parent company sanlam personal finance (spf) saw modest 4% increase volumes r433m now 12% market share large risk policies sold by independent financial advisers (ifas) making fourth largest player average monthly premiums r1400 there minimum client need only cover currently writing half all lump sum disability policies products distributed 4400 ifas takes what called needs based approach which too complex manage back cigarette box effect six separate mini policies cover household needs debt childcare death related costs (such estate duty) health care unexpected costs debt children can reweighted take care expected increases other benefits fallen overall curbed &#8220;

Make sure you understand how your policy works, as there are differences between insurers.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p>When you want to make ad hoc increases to your insurance cover, you typically have to undergo underwriting so that your insurer can reassess your risk.<br />\nThis means you have to answer questions about your health and undergo tests which could mean a higher premium or an exclusion on the new cover. Increasingly, insurers are offering &#8220;future<br />\ninsurability&#8221; benefits allowing you to: buy more life, disability and critical illness cover, extend your cover, and freeze and reinstate your cover &#8211; without being subject to underwriting or providing a declaration of health. But not all insurers&#8217; future insurability benefits are alike, and some still insist on an HIV test when they underwrite you for the additional cover. With most risk policies, you have to agree to an annual cover increase that applies on the anniversary of your policy. These increases aren&#8217;t subject to underwriting. But ad hoc increases in cover most likely will be. You can suspend an annual increase or cancel future increases, but typically should you later decide to reinstate the annual increases, you will have to be underwritten. Check with your insurer what will happen should you wish to alter your cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Increase your cover</strong></p>\n<p>Two newer assurers, FMI and BrightRock, let you increase your cover without underwriting, even if you&#8217;ve had a claim and have a loading or an exclusion on your policy, and this will not cost you an additional premium. Elmarie Samuel, FMI&#8217;s product specialist, says FMI lets you increase your cover without underwriting or an HIV test even if you do not have an annual benefit increase. Schalk Malan, CEO of BrightRock, says all BrightRock policyholders can double their initial cover without underwriting at any time up until the maximum age for taking out cover. As a Liberty policyholder who qualifies for an Offer of Additional Cover you can increase most of your lump-sum cover within 24 months of being underwritten, but you must declare that there have been no<br />\nchanges to your health since your policy was issued, says Henk Meintjes, the head of risk products at Liberty. Those Liberty policyholders with the Future Income Assessment facility can make changes to their disability income protection annually without underwriting or a statement of good health, Meintjes says. But only if you don&#8217;t have any health loadings, haven&#8217;t claimed in the past 12 months, haven&#8217;t reached the policy anniversary preceding your 55th birthday and have an automatic benefit increase on the policy. Beyond agreed annual increases, Sanlam policyholders can increase their income protection without underwriting by up to twice the inflation rate, or 20%. Sanlam policyholders with the Future Cover benefit can increase lump-sum benefits up to 25% at each occurrence of certain life events, such as marriage or birth of a child, without underwriting. Any other increases will be subject to underwriting, says Petrie Marx, a risk product actuary at Sanlam.&nbsp;Dirk Claassens, a product development specialist at Momentum Myriad, says any ad hoc increases to cover which exceed the annual benefit increase are subject to underwriting unless you have the paid-for Future Cover benefit, providing cover increases for specific life events. With Momentum, you have to take an HIV test when you increase your cover. On an FMI policy, you can increase your cover by up to 25% in the event of marriage, divorce, childbirth, adoption, death of a spouse or the purchase of a property. The increase applies to each event. This benefit is part of the cover and comes at no extra cost. Malan says BrightRock has no predetermined limits per life event &#8211; you can choose any increase at any time with no underwriting up to twice your initial cover. Discovery clients can take out the Future Fund Benefit for an additional premium. Gareth Friedlander, the head of research and development at Discovery Life, says that under this<br />\nbenefit you can, without evidence of health and insurability, increase your cover, within limits, in the event of marriage, the birth or adoption of a child, an increase in your bond cover and an increase in your interest in a partnership.&nbsp;&#8220;In certain cases, a health declaration may be required or full underwriting may be called for,&#8221; Friedlander says. On certain life events, you may also be<br />\nable to increase your lump-sum disability and income protection cover with no underwriting, depending on your Vitality status and state of health.</p>\n<p><strong>Extend the term</strong></p>\n<p>Since we&#8217;re living longer, many of us will need to work for longer. Samuel says FMI allows you to extend your cover up to the age of 70, provided you make a declaration of health. Malan says BrightRock allows you to redirect your premiums to new cover when your needs change, whenever you need to and without underwriting. Friedlander says Discovery Life&#8217;s Income Continuation Benefit automatically allows you to claim an income when you are unable to do your job up to the age of 70. The policy benefit then converts to a Long-Term Care Benefit, which will pay out if a disability impairs your daily activities. Meintjes says Liberty&#8217;s Lifestyle Protector also offers disability cover (lump sum and income) and critical illness benefits for the whole of your life. You select this benefit either at inception or when you make changes to your policy, but this is subject to underwriting. If you choose cover for a specified term, such as up to your retirement age of 65, you may qualify to extend your cover without underwriting at the end of that term, or if certain life events occur, he says. Marx says Sanlam does not offer an extension-of-cover option, but you can extend sickness and disability income benefits to age 70, subject to underwriting. The term for your lump-sum disability benefits must be selected upfront.</p>\n<p><strong>Freeze your cover</strong></p>\n<p>FMI offers a freeze benefit which allows you to freeze your cover and premiums for three or six months. The benefit comes at no extra cost. When the freeze benefit period lapses, premiums are reinstated without under writing or a declaration of health. The benefit, which could prove useful if you are retrenched or fall on hard times, can be used only once and after the policy has been in<br />\nplace for at least a year. Discovery allows you to reinstate a policy within 24 months of it lapsing on nonpayment. A declaration of health or underwriting may apply. Liberty allows you to reduce your benefits and premiums on a Lifestyle Protector policy for up to six months. Thereafter, you can increase your benefits to what they were prior to the reduction (or a lesser amount) without underwriting.</p>\n<p><em>This&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>article was written&nbsp;</em><em>by Angelique Ardé and&nbsp;</em><em>originally published in the Sunday Times on 24 March 2019.&nbsp;</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["benefits","brightrock","child-expenses","childcare-cover","childcare-needs","insurance-gap","life-insurance","marriage","underwriting"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"increase your cover with future insurability brightrock benefits mean that when want life after major event such birth child marriage divorce may entitled &nbsp;without undergoing new under writing process make sure understand how policy works there are differences between [&hellip;] insurers &nbsp;

From a zero base at its product launch in March 2012, BrightRock has grown rapidly, increasing its market share to 12% of the market for large risk policies sold by independent financial advisers – making it the fourth largest provider in this market based on new business volumes.</p>\n<p>During the 2018 financial year, BrightRock maintained its position as the fastest-growing provider in this segment, achieving strong organic growth. Total premium income across its businesses increased by 43% year on year and annualised premium income of R433 million was activated in 2018. This is despite tough market conditions – the category saw just a 12% increase in the number of risk policies sold between July 2017 and June 2018. With reporting season still underway, it is too early to provide definitive figures but indications are that many insurers have experienced single digit growth in risk policy sales and an increase in first-year risk policy lapses during 2018.</p>\n<p>According to Schalk Malan, BrightRock CEO, a key driver of the company’s growth has been the increased uptake of its needs-matched offering by independent financial advisers (IFAs) operating in the upper income segment. The company currently has more than 4&nbsp;200 accredited IFAs distributing its product nationwide. In particular, its permanent disability cover is making significant inroads in this market.</p>\n<p>“We came to market just seven years ago with a fundamentally different product design that precisely matches client’s needs and adapts seamlessly to changes in their lives. It’s a client-centric approach that creates a unique solution for each and every client.”</p>\n<p>One of the major benefits of this structure, according to Malan, is its efficiency. “By shaping clients’ cover to match their changing needs over time, we are able to strip out unnecessary waste, which creates premium savings for clients. For example, when it comes to cover for their permanent expense needs, BrightRock clients get – on average – double the amount of disability cover for the same premium rand”, said Malan.</p>\n<p>On the back of the growth of its individual life offering, 2018 saw the launch of BrightRock’s group risk offering. This was an important step – according to Malan – in the firm’s planned expansion into new markets. BrightRock currently operates in the individual life, life assistance, and group risk markets with ambitions to add new product lines to its offering in the medium to long term. The company’s recent move, necessitated by its rapid growth, from Parktown to its new head office in Sandton was another important step.</p>\n<p>“Our ambition is to leverage the unique principles of our proprietary, needs-matched approach to build BrightRock into a financial services player of scale. Our new premises place us at the centre of South Africa’s financial district and offer us scalability and scope for growth”, said Malan. He also states that the business will be looking to grow its distribution footprint further in the near future, with the addition of new channels.</p>\n<p>Besides growing traction in the SA market, BrightRock has garnered international attention in Germany, Australia and the USA. Most recently, in October, Malan was invited to speak at an international industry conference in New York, hosted by LIMRA, about how BrightRock has harnessed client-centric product design to innovate and create opportunity.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting to get that outsiders’ perspective. South Africa is hailed as the innovation leader in the international life insurance industry and BrightRock is gaining recognition as being at the forefront”, said Malan of his reception there.</p>\n<p>Speaking of BrightRock’s growing presence in the financial services market, Malan also commented on the company’s positive relationship with its majority shareholder, Sanlam: “We’re privileged to have a great shareholder that supports our client-centric outlook and is supportive of our growth and future prospects.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About BrightRock</strong></p>\n<p>BrightRock was established in 2011 with the goal of offering highly differentiated life insurance products to better meet clients’ and financial advisers’ needs. Since entering the South African intermediated individual risk market in April 2012 with its proprietary needs-matched offering, the company has become one of the fastest growing players in its category.</p>\n<p>BrightRock’s needs-matched life insurance cover is uniquely structured to match client’s life insurance needs very precisely at the outset and change as their needs change over time. In 2017, Sanlam acquired a majority stake in BrightRock.</p>\n<p>BrightRock is headquartered in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth with regional hubs in the major centres of Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Bloemfontein and Cape Town, and a national distribution footprint through more than 4 200 independent financial advisers. BrightRock Life is an authorised financial services provider and registered insurer.

But what exactly is it for, and how can it make a positive difference in your life? <span style=\"color: #ffcc00;\"><strong>Schalk Malan, CEO of BrightRock</strong></span>, explains why you might not be covered for as much as you think.</p>\n<p><b>It’s there to protect your income …</b></p>\n<p>It’s important to think of your income as your biggest asset – it enables you to afford necessary assets like a home and car, childcare and healthcare. And if group risk cover is included as one of your employee benefits, it is there to enable you to continue to afford these expenses and honour your responsibilities in the event of a debilitating injury or serious illness. But while the lump sum figures provided by long term insurance products like your group risk cover often look very big, it may not be sufficient to provide you with the income you need. This is because only 15% of your needs are likely to be covered</p>\n<p>Most group risk cover products only cover around 15% of beneficiaries’ financial needs. So while your group risk cover plays an important role in providing a basic level of risk cover in your financial plan, you’ll still have to look into signing up for individual cover to fill a financial gap for up to 85% of your financial needs. Newer, needs-matched role players in the market are challenging this industry norm by providing you with twice as much cover. So while cover amounting to 30% of your needs still isn’t sufficient to cover your full financial needs in the event of your death, critical illness, or disability, it goes a long way to closing the gap.</p>\n<p><b>It’s meant to be a long term commitment …</b></p>\n<p>Think of your existing group risk cover as a long term commitment that will provide you access to your lost income when you need it most. While it’s easy to change short-term policies like car or household insurance, it’s not that simple to change a long term insurance policy, because your health deteriorates over time and the likelihood of you claiming increases as you get older. And insurers require tedious medical underwriting to determine how much your level of risk has increased when you want to increase cover. That’s why it’s advisable to place your cover with an insurer that makes it easy to increase your cover when your needs change without having to do be asked health questions or go for blood tests.</p>\n<p><b>But you’ll probably lose your cover when you change jobs</b></p>\n<p>In the modern world of work, where technology continues to create new opportunities, you’re unlikely to stay with the same employer for very long. This means you will lose a substantial amount of your long-term cover when you change jobs, and you might have to sign up for new, or additional cover to make up for a shortfall. But if your employer signed up for needs-matched group risk cover, this might not be the case, as it allows to convert it to individual cover with no underwriting required.</p>\n<p><b>Permanent is not as permanent as you think</b></p>\n<p>If your employer is signed up for a traditional group risk policy, it’s likely that you have limited benefits, with limited pay-outs – not to mention a massive amount of red tape when you claim. For example, the majority of group risk cover providers will require permanently disabled employees to undergo continual reassessments after successful claims to keep receiving their income protection benefit payments. Some providers’ critical illness cover is also very limited, covering only a small number of conditions. A needs-matched provider can offer critical illness cover for more than 200 conditions. When it comes to disability claims, a new generation provider will pay out for your valid claim for certain conditions, regardless of whether or not you can still do your job.</p>\n<p><b>So what next?</b></p>\n<p>Check your group risk benefit schedule, and speak to your HR department to check what you’re covered for. If you’re not happy with what you see, or are struggling to get to the bottom of it, contact your nearest independent financial adviser to make sure you’ve got adequate cover.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published in the The Witness and Personal Finance on 29 November 2018. <a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/personal-finance/5-things-to-know-about-group-risk-cover-as-an-employee-benefit-18310690\">Click here </a>to read the original online version.</em></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["brightrock","cover","disability-cover","group-risk","insurance","policy","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"5 things know about group risk cover employee benefit brightrock likely one deductions your pay cheque are receiving benefits part monthly salary what exactly how can make positive difference life schalk malan ceo brightrock explains why might [&hellip;] covered much think ’s there protect income … important think biggest asset – enables afford necessary assets like home car childcare healthcare included benefits enable continue these expenses honour responsibilities event debilitating injury serious illness while lump sum figures provided by long term insurance products often look very big may sufficient provide with need this because only 15% needs most around beneficiaries’ financial needs plays role providing basic level plan ’ll still have into signing individual fill gap 85% newer needs matched players market challenging industry norm twice cover amounting 30% isn’t full death critical illness disability goes way closing gap meant commitment existing that will access lost when need most easy change short term policies car household insurance simple policy health deteriorates over time likelihood claiming increases get older insurers require tedious medical underwriting determine increased want increase that’s advisable place insurer makes without having asked questions go blood tests probably lose jobs modern world work where technology continues create new opportunities ’re unlikely stay same employer long means substantial amount long term jobs sign new additional shortfall signed cover case allows convert required permanent traditional limited pay outs mention massive red tape claim example majority providers permanently disabled employees undergo continual reassessments after successful claims keep their protection payments some providers’ illness also limited covering small number conditions provider offer more than 200 comes disability claims generation out valid claim certain conditions regardless whether job next check schedule speak hr department happy see struggling bottom contact nearest independent adviser sure ’ve got adequate &nbsp; article originally published witness personal finance 29 november 2018 click here read original online version content staging news disability cover group risk policy schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"related_posts":null,"guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null}},"id":5619,"date":"1 Nov, 18","author":"BrightRock","heading":"How BrightRock Is Disrupting The Insurance Industry With These 2 Pivotal Strategies","excerpt":"<p>By Monique Verduyn Developments in technology, and clear communication are positioning BrightRock to disrupt their industry and transform the consumer experience.

Today, BrightRock is the fastest-growing insurer in the intermediated individual life risk market. It also provides underwriting management services to funeral parlour businesses and, more recently, has entered the group risk insurance market, offering its needs-matched approach to employees.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The founders of BrightRock, established in 2011, knew the life insurance industry all too well, and they found its methodology wanting. “Traditional life insurance lumps all the individual’s needs into one policy,” says CEO Schalk Malan.</p></blockquote>\n<p>“It’s a methodology that has been around for centuries. We started afresh and looked at how we could design life insurance based on individual requirements. Our cover is designed to exactly match each specific financial need. Because there is no waste, it’s more cost efficient and sustainable. And if circumstances change and our customer needs more cover, it’s easy to get it because needs-matched design enables the policy to change in line with changing needs.”</p>\n<p><strong>1. Embracing digital technology to provide needs-matched insurance</strong></p>\n<p>Suzanne Stevens, marketing executive director at BrightRock, points out that this type of innovation achieves efficiency (cost savings) and effectiveness (higher returns). “By harnessing digital technology, we have made our operations more efficient, and aggressively lowered costs by up to 30% for our customers. Every rand they spend with us works harder for them. That’s the benefit of a solution designed around the customer.”</p>\n<p>BrightRock’s founders took a similar approach. ‘We ditched legacy thinking in favour of creating a product that is intuitive and easy to navigate. An enormous amount of time and effort went into writing and designing that system, and creating the optimal customer journey.”</p>\n<p>Unlike clunky legacy systems, BrightRock’s platform is modularised, and was built according to the agile principle of rapid delivery cycles. The result is a technology stack with longevity, that is also flexible enough to be tweaked when needed.</p>\n<p>“The advantage of the technology available today is that you can plug things in and pull them out as required,” says Suzanne. “That’s one of the enablers of a truly disruptive mindset. To step away from accepted norms and find new solutions requires curiosity and creativity, as well as a lot of courage to go up against large incumbents in the market. There is always resistance to new technology, although we are fortunate in this country to have one of the most innovative insurance sectors in the world.”</p>\n<p><strong>2. Effective communication is critical</strong></p>\n<p>These disruptors have set themselves above the rest through one surprisingly simple tactic —  effective communication. They agree that it simply doesn’t matter how world-changing your product or service is if you don’t communicate it to the right audience at the right time. New companies that fail to communicate their remarkable new development will quickly be pushed aside by other disruptors. Without a clear communication strategy that reaches the audience in the industry you’re trying to disrupt, you’ll set yourself up for failure. A key question to ask when you are developing your communication strategy is simply whether people understand what you do.</p>\n<p>“Because the premise for our product was fundamentally different from anything on the market, communication and clear messaging were critical to convincing our clients to put their trust in us,” says Schalk.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It was especially important to educate insurance advisors so they would understand what we were doing, why we were doing it, and how it was better than the other options available. That was key to disrupting the individual life market.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Currently, BrightRock employs 380 staff, has experienced 40% year-on-year growth, and has an annualised premium income of more than R1,3 billion. The company has recently entered the group risk environment with a similar offering that addresses many of the same shortcomings of traditional group risk products. “The inefficiencies of the structuring of group products has meant that, to remain competitive, insurers have cut the benefits offered to employees, undermining their sense of financial security. Change is needed, and we believe our needs-matched philosophy positions us to change the group risk market too.”</p>\n<p>‘We ditched legacy thinking in favour of creating a product that is intuitive and easy to navigate. An enormous amount of time and effort went into writing and designing that system, and creating the optimal customer journey.”</p>\n<p>Unlike clunky legacy systems, the BrightRock’s platform is modularised, and was built according to the agile principle of rapid delivery cycles. The result is a technology stack with longevity, that is also flexible enough to be tweaked when needed.</p>\n<p>This iterative, modular approach typically begins with defining the strategy and programme plan upfront, delivering a core capability fast so it can provide benefits immediately, and then continuously improving with regular, incremental capability improvements to achieve the objectives of the strategy. It’s an approach that fosters closer collaboration between stakeholders, improved transparency, earlier delivery, greater allowance for change and more focus on the business outcomes.</p>\n<p>“The advantage of the technology available today is that you can plug things in and pull them out as required,” says Suzanne. “That’s one of the enablers of a truly disruptive mindset. To step away from accepted norms and find new solutions requires curiosity and creativity, as well as a lot of courage to go up against large incumbents in the market.

The truth is, the industry can do better. A focus on the individual within the group is possible and is necessary.</p>\n<p>The problem is that, for the most part, group cover uses a flat multiple salary model, which is usually between one and three times an employees’ annual salary. At first glance, it seems as if every employee is receiving exactly the same level of coverage.</p>\n<p>But this couldn’t be further from the truth; the cover allocations could leave younger employees significantly more underinsured while employees closer to retirement, with fewer pay cheques to protect, may be over insured, or have far more of their needs covered, relative to the majority of the (younger) workforce.</p>\n<p>Coverage needs to align more closely to the underlying financial need. By using an approach that calculates each member’s total value of future pay cheques and covering a consistent percentage of this future income for all employees, it is possible to achieve a fairer split of the groups cover. In doing so, it would allow the group to also buy more cover, for the same premium.</p>\n<p><strong>Claims assessment </strong></p>\n<p>In times of economic downturn, employees tend to claim more from group disability cover. This creates uncertainty even for employees with legitimate medical impairments.</p>\n<p>By doing away with subjective occupation-based assessments that rely solely on income loss, insurers can introduce claim certainty while managing risk.</p>\n<p>Following the individual life market’s lead, it is possible to assess disability claims on clinical criteria for a list of defined conditions. A more certain, objective claims assessment also removes the need for in-claim reassessment of permanent disability claims.</p>\n<p>Insurance of this sort gives certainty to the employee while sparing employers and advisers the administrative burden that comes with these claims.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexibility and choice </strong></p>\n<p>A focus on the individual within the group requires a disruptive insurer that understands the same pay-out structure may not be suited for every disability or death claim. Employees cannot know in advance whether a lump-sum or income would meet their new financial circumstance or medical prognosis at the time of claiming. Progressive insurers give the employee or beneficiaries an option to choose between a recurring pay-out or a lump-sum when they claim. This guarantees that they can choose the pay-out that delivers the best value.</p>\n<p>Group risk cover also makes it possible for individual members who might otherwise struggle to secure cover to benefit from the scheme’s risk rating. But the cover is usually well below their actual need.</p>\n<p>Insurers should make it easier for employees to buy more cover if they need it, without underwriting. A needs-matched approach offers individuals the flexibility to buy up to double their cover amount – up to the free cover limit – without individual underwriting. When employees change jobs, they forfeit their cover and years of group cover premiums paid. Forward-thinking insurers should allow members to take their policies with them when they leave, affordably and without underwriting.</p>\n<p><strong>Winds of change</strong></p>\n<p>The industry needs insurers who focus on the individual within the bigger group. Change is needed, and a needs-matched philosophy positions a good insurer to change the group risk market by better meeting people’s needs.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Schalk Malan is the CEO of BrightRock.</em></li>\n<li><em>This article was first published on 01 November 2018 by FA News (page 70).</em></li>\n</ul>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["claims","cover","fa-news","group-risk","needs-matched"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"pulling punches avoid knock out blow brightrock name suggests focus group risk benefits provide coverage rather than meeting specific individual’s precise needs further with average south african income earner holding cover less 40% their needs event death important role plays [&hellip;] providing least basic level financial protection undeniable areas improvement yet one size fits all approach often leaves individual employees substantially underinsured truth industry can better within possible necessary problem that most part uses flat multiple salary model which usually between one three times employees’ annual salary first glance seems every employee receiving exactly same coverage this couldn’t further from truth; allocations could leave younger significantly more underinsured while closer retirement fewer pay cheques protect may over insured have far covered relative majority (younger) workforce align closely underlying need by using that calculates each member’s total value future covering consistent percentage all employees achieve fairer split groups cover doing would allow also buy cover premium claims assessment economic downturn tend claim disability creates uncertainty even legitimate medical impairments away subjective occupation based assessments rely solely loss insurers introduce certainty managing risk following life market’s lead assess clinical criteria list defined conditions certain objective removes need claim reassessment permanent claims insurance sort gives sparing employers advisers administrative burden comes these flexibility choice requires disruptive insurer understands pay out structure suited death claim cannot know advance whether lump sum meet new circumstance prognosis time claiming progressive give beneficiaries option choose recurring when they guarantees delivers best value makes members who might otherwise struggle secure benefit scheme’s rating well below actual should make easier without underwriting needs matched offers individuals double amount – free limit change jobs forfeit years premiums paid forward thinking take policies them leave affordably winds bigger group needed philosophy positions good market better people’s &nbsp; schalk malan ceo brightrock article published 01 november 2018 fa news (page 70) content staging fa news group risk"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":9489,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":5611,"date":"1 Oct, 18","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Tackling a weighty issue","excerpt":"<p>According to the World Bank, in 2013, the average South African has a life expectancy of 56.74 years.

This is an increase of almost five years since 2005. </strong></p>\n<p>However, we are also getting more obese. Approximately 61% of South Africans are overweight or obese, making us the most obese country in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>\n<p>Considering some of the conditions associated with obesity &#8211; which includes type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer as well as stroke and depression &#8211; there is reason for concern.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct proportions</strong></p>\n<p>While it is important to remember that mortality is directly proportionate to the level of obesity³, many of the health risks associated with obesity can be managed, thanks to medical advances. Further, there is a need for the industry to factor in the long-term burden of some of the conditions associated with obesity.</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional approaches </strong></p>\n<p>The industry commonly relies on the body mass index (BMI) to determine whether an individual is obese. According to the world health organisation, a BMI of more than 30 qualifies as obese. Most insurers classify obese clients into large bands. This results in the same loading being applied to all clients in that band.</p>\n<p>There is a consequence of this approach. If – for example – there is a mortality loading increase from 50% (between a BMI band of 33 to 37) to 100% (between a BMI band of 38 to 43), a client with a marginally higher BMI (38 as opposed to 37), will have to pay for the huge discrepancy between the premiums of different bands.</p>\n<p>Another concern with this approach is that it may discriminate against healthy clients who happen to have higher BMIs. Certain clients do have higher muscle mass and not fat; this contributes to their overall weight.</p>\n<p>The fair approach to underwriting high BMI forward-thinking cover providers follow a more reasonable approach by smoothing out the drastic jumps in loading values between the traditional bands. In this instance, a 45-year-old client with a BMI of 37.7 would get a 50% extra-mortality loading on his cover, if the client would sign up for a more forward-thinking product that smooths out the stepped approach to BMI, this could even result in an overall premium increase of less than 30%.</p>\n<p>The insurer will also remove the mortality loading in full if the client is otherwise healthy⁴. This will ensure that more active clients with higher BMIs which are caused by high muscle mass are treated fairly.</p>\n<p><strong>Managing the expectations </strong></p>\n<p>While obesity is a sensitive matter to discuss with clients, managing their expectations from the start will reduce the possibility of any awkwardness or conflict at a later stage.</p>\n<p>Start by ensuring that they sign up for needs-matched cover with a fairer underwriting approach and BMI categorisation. It is also important to ascertain if your clients have any chronic conditions which are caused by obesity. Advisers then need to explain why and how loadings might be applied.</p>\n<p>It is also important to explain to your clients that there are market players that will review this after a six to twelve-month period after achieving the healthier weight level.</p>\n<p><strong>Frank conversations </strong></p>\n<p>By having frank and transparent conversations from the start and by selecting a product that does not discriminate or leave them short-changed, the financial adviser, can make a positive difference in your clients’ lives. All clients deserve to be treated fairly; heavier clients should be no exception.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>¹ South African obesity rate on the rise. Published by 702 on 24 July 2017.

This is when<br />\nindividuals with a specific set of skills leave mainstream employment to offer their services<br />\nfreelance. This is partly driven by a desire for more flexibility but mostly from the reality that companies are no longer hiring permanent staff. Instead of being paid a regular salary, workers are self-employed and paid for each &#8220;gig&#8221; they do.</p>\n<p>Personally, I have been self-employed and working gigs for 14 years and my biggest risk is not being able to work if I become ill or have an accident.</p>\n<p>While risk cover is important for everyone, when you work for yourself there is no sick pay or employee benefits &#8211; if I cannot bill my hours, I don&#8217;t get paid.</p>\n<p>The starting point is having an emergency fund that covers up to three months of expenses or, at the very least, having at least one month of expenses covered.</p>\n<p>The next step is to take out income protection, however, this is not as simple for a self-employed<br />\nperson as it is for someone who receives a regular income. Sadly, it appears that few South African insurers are bringing products to market that are relevant to self employed individuals. As a simple example, insurers do not provide the ability to pay lump sum premiums, yet I should be able to purchase my insurance during good billing months and still be covered during poor billing<br />\nmonths.</p>\n<p>What I have also discovered is the challenge of knowing what you will actually get paid at the claims stage if you have a variable income. One of the rules of income protection or disability cover is that you cannot be in a better financial position after the claim than you were before &#8211; but how does that work when your income is variable and how is the income determined?</p>\n<p><strong>How much of my income will be paid out? </strong></p>\n<p>When you initially take out cover, it will be based on your income at the time. However, according to Jaco Gouws, protection product head at Old Mutual Personal Finance, the payout will be based on the client&#8217;s income at the time of their illness or injury, not necessarily the income that was insured (assuming that the amount insured was equal or higher). In other words, if I was<br />\ninsured and paying a premium based on R40 000 income per month, but I had a bad year of billing before my claim, earning on average R20 000 per month, I may only be paid out based on the last 12 months of income.</p>\n<p>This is very important if you are leaving a company to start your own business. If your cover is based on your corporate salary, it may take you a year or two to build up to those income levels, but if you are injured or chronically ill, your claim will be based on your new self-employed income level, according to both Old Mutual and Discovery Life. So you need to notify the insurer so the benefits and premium are based on the new occupation and salary.</p>\n<p>Insurer BrightRock has a different approach. CEO Schalk Malan says clients can maintain their full cover while in a lower paying job, or even if they go on extended leave or become unemployed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Self-employed individuals have to let us know when they stop working, and the cover will remain in place for up to 12 months, regardless of the form of employment,&#8221; says Malan, who adds that in the case of a permanent disability, after 12 months of not working or earning less, clients&#8217; permanent expenses cover (and payouts on claim) can maintain the higher levels, provided proof of income was received for the original income.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If a client submitted proof of income at the inception of the policy and lodges a permanent claim, we are not concerned with the income at claims stage, as the client has been paying premiums for the higher cover amount.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Malan adds that at the time of the claim on temporary expenses, although BrightRock requires proof of the income, they don&#8217;t require proof of loss of income &#8211; in other words, the client does not need to prove that they have lost any income as a result of being temporarily disabled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Imagine how hard this is for someone who has a fluctuating income, or for clients where there&#8217;s quite a lag between the work having been done and the income being received. The compounding effect of this is that when they aren&#8217;t working because of an illness or injury, they still get the funds for work done a few months before, so they can&#8217;t prove a loss of income, and so can&#8217;t get paid out from their insurer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then, when they return to work, there&#8217;s no income for the work that they would have done during the period that they were booked off. There&#8217;s now a serious gap in their income until they can get paid for the work that they only do after their recovery, which might be quite a few months. At BrightRock we try to avoid putting clients in this type of situation.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How is your income calculated?</strong></p>\n<p>As you cannot provide a payslip, insurers calculate your income both at application stage and at claims stage based on your financial statements, SA Revenue Service returns or bank statements.</p>\n<p>Old Mutual considers the share of average monthly sales/fees earned, less the share of cost of sales and less the share of business overhead expenses, averaged over a period, at Old Mutual&#8217;s discretion, of 12 months. If earnings are of a fluctuating nature, at Old Mutual&#8217;s discretion, it may be averaged over a period of, at most, 36 months.</p>\n<p>According to Discovery Life head of market insights, Andrew McCurrie, if the income is of a variable nature, Discovery Life may determine a period other than 12 months to calculate average monthly income.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a sole proprietor, partner, member of a close corporation or director of a private company, Discovery Life will calculate the monthly share of fees for services rendered and gross profit from trading activities, less the individual&#8217;s monthly share of the business overhead expenses and tax.</p>\n<p>As benefits are tax-free, deducting tax is not an issue, however, the critical point here is that overhead expenses are deducted from the income calculation. The problem is that overhead expenses do not disappear when you are unable to work. There may still be rent, connectivity costs, website management, insurance and car finance expenses. Moreover, some of the overhead expenses that a self-employed person may deduct form part of day-to-day expenses. For example, if you work from home you can deduct up to 20% of your mortgage interest and household running costs as overheads.</p>\n<p>Gouws says in this case they take into account 17.5% for fringe benefits, but this may be insufficient. It is also worth noting that if your business is incorporated, then only the salary you withdraw each month would be considered for income assessment.</p>\n<p>Financial planner Markus Bauriedl, says one could consider covering the business overheads of an<br />\nindividual, especially for a professional or sole proprietor, through an overhead expenses benefit.<br />\n&#8220;These are typically overheads that would continue being incurred even when the individual is unable to work. Only certain overhead expenses would qualify, however, which is dependent on the occupation of the individual. Furthermore, it is important to note that an overhead expense can also only be taken as a temporary benefit and does not apply as a permanent expense benefit,&#8221; he explains.</p>\n<p>What is clear is that firstly it is best to get good advice and ask a lot of questions before taking out<br />\ncover. Secondly, the industry needs to start focusing on this growing market for which insurance is equally, if not more, valuable, by creating relevant products. <em>&#8211; ends &#8211;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Fast facts:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Additional cover to consider</em></p>\n<p>Bauriedl recommends a severe illness benefit in conjunction with an income protection benefit, as it is triggered on either a recognised trauma event or the diagnosis of an illness covered under the<br />\nadditional health benefit, without it necessarily resulting in the inability to work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In terms of my experience, many lower severity illness claims are triggered with clients still being<br />\nable to work, such as in the event of cancer, mild heart attacks, mild strokes and trauma events where they can return to work either immediately or soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In this case income protection will not kick in but they are not able to work optimally and their<br />\nincome is affected. Some insurers, like BrightRock&#8217;s trauma IQ benefit, focus on trauma events a lot more than most other insurers, making it particularly relevant to the younger and more active<br />\nmarket that may be more exposed to trauma-related claims&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Financial planner Sylvia Walker argues that good medical cover is equally as important.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many self-employed people cannot afford the full spectrum of cover needed in case of illness, so a<br />\nmore practical approach would be to belong to a good medical aid, so medical costs are taken care<br />\nof, and then the access to cash, in the form of critical illness cover, that can be used in whatever<br />\nway it is needed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what is so great about this cover &#8211; the flexibility it provides. It&#8217;s not just for medical expenses, or loss of income, et cetera. It buys time to heal, a very important consideration for someone who is working for themselves.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>This article was first published in City Press (page 10 &#8211;

Having the right cover in place enables you to continue to meet these expenses in the event of a debilitating injury or serious illness.</p>\n<p>Wouter Fourie, a certified financial planner and director of Ascor Independent Wealth Managers, says ideally you should choose a combination of lump-sum and income benefits when you take out risk cover.</p>\n<p>The lump sum can be used to settle debts such as your home loan if you become critically ill or disabled, while the income will cover your monthly living expenses.</p>\n<p>However, if you are already debt-free, then an income product is the one to go for, says Fourie.</p>\n<p>Ian Beere, a certified financial planner and MD at Netto Invest, says lump-sum benefits and income benefits both have a place.</p>\n<p>He says it is good to leave a lump sum to settle debts, plus some as a buffer for unexpected expenses, and allocate the rest as an annuity for the benefit of those who are not good with managing their money.</p>\n<p>However, the disadvantage of an income payment is that it may lack flexibility.</p>\n<p>If you are disabled, for example, you may need to overspend in the short term to alter a property to cater for your disability. This may be more difficult if you are locked into an income benefit, says Beere.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"c5daa715-07d0-1cd3-39bb-247d41f020bd\" class=\"article-widget article-widget-text\">\n<div class=\"wrap\">\n<div class=\"text\">\n<p>He says if you choose an income benefit you need to ensure that the income you are going to receive on the death or disability<br />\nescalates by the inflation rate &#8211; and that you are not going to emigrate.</p>\n<p>Malan says newer insurance policies provide cover that is matched to your needs and can be adapted as your needs change over time.</p>\n<p>Because everyone&#8217;s needs are different and cannot always be predicted, a good policy should offer you the ability to change your chosen lump-sum benefit to any combination of guaranteed ongoing income and lump sum at claims stage, when you know what your needs are, he says.</p>\n<p>Malan doesn&#8217;t agree that permanent disability lump-sum cover is best suited for lifestyle changes that arise when you are disabled.</p>\n<p>He says lifestyle adjustment costs may arise regardless of whether you are permanently disabled or not &#8211; for example, if you have stage 1 cancer, you may have some lifestyle expenses but you won&#8217;t necessarily be regarded as permanently disabled, and will probably only qualify for a critical illness payout and not lump-sum disability cover.</p>\n<p>Newer insurance offerings allow you to approach these lifestyle adjustment costs covered by separate benefits, he says.</p>\n<p>BrightRock avoids using language such as &#8220;disability, death and dread disease&#8221; cover, says Malan, because we don&#8217;t always understand the differences in these cover types. Instead it offers cover for each type of financial need, such as household expenses, childcare needs, or debt, so you can determine precisely how much cover you need.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"42849373-5068-b7aa-4b31-c59d7e90bd81\" class=\"article-widget article-widget-hr\">\n<div class=\"wrap\">\n<hr />\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"cba292ca-4ab1-ea73-4a22-47d0e12cfa3e\" class=\"article-widget article-widget-text\">\n<div class=\"wrap\">\n<div class=\"text\">\n<h2>Tips to remember</h2>\n<p>Lump-sum disability cover can be taken out as an accelerated benefit on a life policy and this will cost less than stand-alone cover.</p>\n<p>• An accelerated benefit pays out only once &#8211; so if you are disabled it will pay out then, and when you die there will either be no benefit or only the balance of the benefit.</p>\n<p>The rationale for this is that if, for example, the benefit settles your home loan on disability, then you don&#8217;t need a benefit covering this debt when you die.</p>\n<p>• Rebalance your insurance portfolio regularly and whenever there is an event like a new baby, a new house or a new job.</p>\n<p>The need you have to replace your income generally reduces as you grow older and your children leave the home and become self-sufficient.</p>\n<p>• Compare risk products between providers but understand that a cheaper premium may mean fewer benefits, exclusion clauses, different definitions of disability, different premium increases or a different term cover, to age 55 or 75 or for life.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><em>This article was originally published in the Sunday Times &#8211;

When it comes to group risk cover, it’s becoming increasingly important to find a solution that matches the needs of everyone in a business.</p>\n<p>It’s no secret that the world of work, as we know it, is changing. In a 2017 employee benefits study, US insurer MetLife found that 58% of employees surveyed “want customised benefit options based on their personal information”. And according to the same study, 73% of employees believe their employers are responsible for their health and financial wellbeing. And in spite of this expectation, modern employees are unlikely to stay with the same employers for very long, because technology continues to create new opportunities.</p>\n<p>In this competitive, changing job economy, it’s important for businesses to be as attractive as possible by offering their employees benefits that truly match their needs. If you’re advising a client about group risk cover for a business, it’s important to think of your client as a custodian of his or her employees’ financial security. And in terms of group risk cover, the financial security not only lies in the cover itself, but in offering benefits that add real value to employees’ financial planning – especially when considering that it’s the employees who are paying for their cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does a business need group risk cover?</strong></p>\n<p>Employers buy group risk cover for the people in the company to cover their future pay cheques in case something happens where they can’t work before they retire.</p>\n<p>However, traditional group risk products don’t come close to meeting the actual need. They typically offer blunt amounts of cover that are equal to, for example, three years of pay cheques for everyone in the company – irrespective of how many pay cheques they have left before retirement. As a result of this approach, younger people in the company have less cover compared to what they need, relative to their older colleagues who have fewer pay cheques left to cover.</p>\n<p>Traditional group risk products also offer very little flexibility, leaving employees with little, or no option to buy more cover above what employers secured. They also don’t offer a choice between lump-sum or recurring payouts when members claim, and often don’t secure employees’ ability to take their cover with them, should they decide to leave the company.</p>\n<p><strong>So how will you know you’ve selected the right cover?</strong></p>\n<p>Start by looking out for a product that works out how many pay cheques need to be covered for each employee, and then gives every person in the company the same level of cover in proportion to the amount of pay cheques left until retirement. By following this approach, the group risk scheme will provide more people in the company with much more cover. There already are forward-thinking group risk cover providers in the market that manage to offer up to 50% more cover by following this approach.</p>\n<p>Secondly, look out for cover that enables employees to buy more cover – free of underwriting. There are innovative products on the market that offer up to double the cover with no medical underwriting, which enables employees to benefit from the employer group’s insurability to close gaps in their insurance. And – in the spirit of the modern world of work with a more mobile workforce – these innovative products enable employees to take the cover with them when they decide to leave your client’s company. So that, instead of a potential grudge purchase, their group risk cover becomes an asset in the employee’s hands.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to ascertain whether the policyholders in the scheme will be able to choose between a lump sum and recurring pay-outs when they claim. Traditional group risk policies tend to expect employers to choose between lump sum or recurring payouts on behalf of all of their employees when they take out the cover. Forward thinking cover providers have turned this approach on its head, offering employees the option to choose between recurring or lump sum payouts when they claim.</p>\n<p>The importance of claims certainty should never be understated, starting with obtaining a clear picture of the clinical conditions the group risk cover actually covers. There are new players in the market that provide extensive and transparent lists of clinical claims conditions for additional expense needs, covering more than 200 conditions.</p>\n<p>And exactly how permanent does the insurer view a claim for a permanent condition? For example, if an employee is diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, will he or she receive a 100% payout on diagnosis, without the prospect of ongoing reassessment? A needs-matched product offering would never require the reassessment of a successful permanent expense needs claim.</p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion …</strong></p>\n<p>You wouldn’t want your clients to be held responsible for choosing employee benefits that did not serve in their employees’ best interests. That’s where you, the financial adviser, can make a positive difference by recommending needs-matched group risk cover. In doing so, you will not only be championing the interests of your clients, but also their employees by providing security and benefits offering real value in the modern world of work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Schalk Malan is the CEO of BrightRock.

For example, for a condition like paraplegia, a critical illness policy will help cover the expenses involving alterations to a home to be wheelchair-friendly.</p>\n<p>Many medical schemes may exclude certain treatments or not cover them in full, or you might have reached your annual limit. In these instances, critical illness cover may just come to the rescue.</p>\n<p>But there are many critical illness policies that have not kept up with the times – especially when it comes to covering the treatment and/or recovery periods following some of the latest medical treatments in the market. If you already have critical illness cover, or are “shopping” for a policy, it is important to go through the fine print to see if they factor in the latest medical advances, and to see if they adjusted the range of conditions they provide cover for to keep up with the latest medical research and survival rates.</p>\n<p><b>How many conditions are covered?</b></p>\n<div id=\"ad-inarticle-middle\" data-google-query-id=\"CL-AlKeN29wCFY6M7Qodev8ETA\">\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/116466607/IOL/personal-finance/why-do-you-need-critical-illness-cover-16321326_4__container__\">Start by obtaining the list of conditions covered by the critical illness policy, because the number of conditions covered vary from company to company. There are life insurance providers that provide cover for over 300 conditions, while some assurers cover fewer than 100 conditions. Some life cover providers also take into account the treatment, clinical impact and effect of an illness, which ensures protection for as yet undiagnosed conditions – this is the kind of cover you should be signing up for.</div>\n</div>\n<p><b>If my injury or illness is so severe that I could die soon after meeting the definition, will I always be paid?</b></p>\n<p>If you were to meet the requirements for a claim, but pass away shortly after, you still may not qualify for a pay-out with some products. A 14 day general survival period would mean your pay-out would be refused, even though you have met the criteria, and incurred additional costs.</p>\n<p><b>How do the payouts work if I have to claim?</b></p>\n<p>You should also consider the pay-out structure and/or –options of your critical illness policy. There are policies with pay-out options that are helpful for conditions that involve large expenses initially, followed by smaller amounts over a number of months. Importantly, you should be allowed to make certain choices about how your cover should pay out at claim stage, when you know what your physical and financial needs are.</p>\n<p><b>What about smaller events, like accidents?</b></p>\n<p>Forward thinking life cover providers have also identified a need for financial protection in instances where you might have&nbsp;less critical, but still traumatic illnesses or injuries and spent little or no time in hospital.</p>\n<p>Just think about the myriad of costs involving corrective procedures, medical aid co-pays, hospital costs, rehabilitation, assistive devices, physiotherapy, wound care, nursing and surgery costs resulting from a traumatic accident. These expenses can all have a financial impact that may not fully be provided for by you existing insurance policies.</p>\n<p><b>And, the most important question</b></p>\n<p>We’re living in a time where innovative services and products are designed to exactly match your individual needs, and your insurance policies should be no exception. So before signing up for a new, critical illness policy, ask yourself: Is my critical illness policy a needs-matched policy that will&nbsp;really&nbsp;make a positive difference in my life, when I need it most?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Schalk Malan is the CEO of BrightRock.

That’s why it’s important to ensure you provide adequate employee benefits, and when it comes to group risk cover, it’s becoming increasingly important to find a solution that matches the needs of everyone in the business.</strong></p>\n<p><em>By Schalk Malan, CEO of BrightRock</em></p>\n<p>It’s no secret that the world of work, as we know it, is changing. In a 2017 employee benefits study, US insurer MetLife found that 58% of employees surveyed “want customised benefit options based on their personal information”. And according to the same study, 73% of employees believe their employer is responsible for employees’ health and financial wellbeing. And in spite of this expectation, modern employees are unlikely to stay with the same employers for very long, because technology continues to create new opportunities.</p>\n<p>It is within this context that it’s important for you, the business owner, to make your business as attractive as possible by offering your employees benefits that truly match their needs. Start by thinking of yourself as a custodian of their financial security. And in terms of group risk cover, the financial security not only lies in the cover itself, but in offering benefits that add real value to your employees’ financial planning – especially when you consider that it is your employees who are contributing towards their cover.</p>\n<h2>Why do you need group risk cover for your business?</h2>\n<p>Employers buy group risk cover for the people in the company to cover their future pay cheques in case something happens where they can’t work before they retire.</p>\n<p>But this, unfortunately, is not the case with traditional group risk products, which typically offer blunt amounts of cover that is equal to, for example, three years of pay cheques for everyone in the company – irrespective of how many pay cheques they have left before retirement. As a result of this approach, younger people in the company have less cover compared to what they need, relative to their older colleagues who have fewer pay cheques left</p>\n<p>Traditional group risk products also offer very little flexibility, leaving employees with little, or no option to buy more cover above what employers secured. They also don’t offer a choice between lump-sum or recurring payouts when members claim, or always secure the ability to take their cover with them, should they decide to leave the company.</p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneurmag.co.za/advice/success-stories/upstarts/how-brightrock-is-rocking-the-industry-boat-in-only-5-years-since-launch/\">How BrightRock Is Rocking The (Industry) Boat In Only 5 Years Since Launch</a></strong></p>\n<h2>So how will you know you’ve selected the right cover?</h2>\n<p>Start by asking your financial adviser to look out for a product that works out how many pay cheques each employee needs to cover, and then gives every person in the company the same level of cover in proportion to the amount of pay cheques left until retirement. By following this approach, your employees’ cover will provide more people in the company with much more cover. There already are forward-thinking group risk cover providers in the market that manage to offer up to 50% more cover by following this approach.</p>\n<p>Secondly, ask your financial adviser if your employees will be able to buy more cover over and above what you secured. There are innovative products on the market that offer up to double the cover free of underwriting, which enables your employees to benefit from the insurability you’re providing them, and to close gaps in their insurance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>And – in the spirit of the modern world of work with a more mobile workforce – these innovative products enable employees to take the cover with them when they decide to leave your company.</h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s also important to ask your financial adviser if your employees will be able to choose between a lump sum and recurring pay-outs when they claim. Traditional group risk policies tend to expect employers to make one choice  between lump sum or recurring payouts on behalf of all of their employees when they take out the cover. Forward thinking cover providers have turned this approach on its head, offering employees the option to choose between recurring or lump sum payouts when they claim.</p>\n<p>The importance of claims certaintly should never be understated, starting with obtaining a clear picture of the clinical conditions the group risk cover actually covers. There are new players in the market that provide extensive and transparent lists of clinical claims conditions for additional expense needs, covering more than 200 conditions.</p>\n<p>And exactly how permanent does the insurer view a claim for a permanent condition? For example, if an employee is to be diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, will he or she receive a 100% payout on diagnosis, without the prospect of ongoing reassessment? A needs-matched product offering would never require the reassessment of permanent expense needs claims.</p>\n<h2>In conclusion …</h2>\n<p>You wouldn’t expect your employees to work under dangerous conditions. So why would you select a group risk product that will not serve in their best interests when they need it most? That’s where needs-matched group risk cover comes to the rescue – not only for your employees, but also for your business by providing security and benefits offering real value in the modern world of work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This article was first published online by Entrepreneur Magazine on 9 July 2018. <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneurmag.co.za/advice/business-leadership/risk-management/how-to-choose-the-right-group-risk-cover-for-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here</a> to read the original version.</li>\n</ul>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["entrepreneur-magazine","group-risk","life-cover","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"how choose right group risk cover your business brightrock clients partners are likely main focus when start out entrepreneur venture grows into fully operative scale employees will matter just much that’s why ’s important ensure provide adequate employee benefits comes [&hellip;] cover becoming increasingly find solution that matches needs everyone business by schalk malan ceo secret world work know changing 2017 benefits study us insurer metlife found 58% surveyed want customised benefit options based their personal information according same 73% believe employer responsible employees’ health financial wellbeing spite this expectation modern unlikely stay with employers very long because technology continues create new opportunities within context owner make attractive possible offering truly match needs thinking yourself custodian security terms security only lies itself add real value planning – especially consider who contributing towards cover need business buy people company future pay cheques case something happens where they can’t work before retire this unfortunately traditional products which typically offer blunt amounts equal example three years irrespective many have left retirement result approach younger less compared what need relative older colleagues fewer products also little flexibility leaving little option more above secured don’t choice between lump sum recurring payouts members claim always secure ability take them should decide leave company related:  rocking (industry) boat 5 since launch ’ve selected cover asking adviser look product works each then gives every person level proportion amount until following much there already forward thinking providers market manage 50% approach secondly ask able over innovative double free underwriting enables from insurability ’re providing close gaps insurance spirit mobile workforce these enable them lump sum pay outs claim policies tend expect one  between behalf all forward turned approach its head importance claims certaintly never understated starting obtaining clear picture clinical conditions actually covers players extensive transparent lists additional expense needs covering than 200 conditions exactly permanent does view claim condition diagnosed stage 4 cancer he she receive 100% payout diagnosis without prospect ongoing reassessment needs matched would require reassessment claims conclusion … wouldn’t under dangerous select serve best interests most rescue employees work article first published online entrepreneur magazine 9 july 2018 click here read original version content staging news entrepreneur magazine group risk life cover schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":13776,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":5542,"date":"4 Jul, 18","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Challenging the status quo in financial services","excerpt":"<p>By Samantha du Chenne At the most recent&nbsp;Financial Mail&nbsp;AdForum event, held in association with Ornico, the financial services sector came under the spotlight.

Typically a competitive industry, financial services has been affected by the constrained economy and by a consumer base that doesn’t believe that bigger is always the best. With an alarming deficit of trust, consumers are willing to give new market players a chance instead of blindly following the traditional market leaders.</p>\n<p>Suzanne Stevens, executive director for marketing at BrightRock, spoke at the AdForum event, saying that marketing an insurance brand in today’s landscape is challenging on many levels. “There is the belief that the financial services sector brought the global economy to its knees; we have consumers who have little trust in brands and to whom legacy and tradition mean very little, not to mention a crop of fin tech start-ups who are taking on the traditional market players – and making headway,” she said.</p>\n<p>In this environment, GDP has shrunk by 2.2%, business confidence is down and the honeymoon phase for the country’s new leadership is now over. President Cyril Ramaphosa is tasked with rebuilding the economy in what is predicted to be a global economic slowdown and there has been a 12% drop in the purchase of new long-term insurance policies. Growing a new business in this environment is no easy task.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"3cd3c894-56b3-d0cb-2f28-8569ee12c760\" class=\"article-widget article-widget-infoblock\"></div>\n<div id=\"d3907221-78b4-6489-a382-b441f67678a0\" class=\"article-widget article-widget-text\">\n<div class=\"wrap\">\n<div class=\"text\">\n<p>Stevens points out that most financial services brands use a one-directional broadcast strategy, with the bulk of their adspend going to television, making the space extremely cluttered. Moreover, with media consumption as fragmented as it is today, and consumers quickly discarding the belief that one must stick to one brand for life, it’s become clear that a new strategy is needed in order to differentiate.</p>\n<p>Behavioural&nbsp;<em>neuroscience</em>&nbsp;has gone a long way towards showing how consumers make decisions, and Stevens reports that decisions about financial services providers are made on an emotional level. “We need to provide consumers with the tools they require to make decisions – the facts and figures – but equally crucial is creating that emotional connection,” she says.</p>\n<p>If financial services companies are to differentiate their brands in this environment, perhaps challenging the status quo is a winning strategy in what has become a hugely competitive environment. Consumers make emotional decisions and we need to connect with them at this level, says Stevens.</p>\n<p>While there is still much value to be found in traditional marketing methods, innovations related to content marketing and social media platforms create opportunities. Stevens says the key premise of the strategy is making emotional connections with consumers and creating conversation and engagement.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"title\"><em>THE BIG TAKE OUT</em></h2>\n<div class=\"description\">\n<p><em>Differentiation in the cluttered financial services sector requires an innovative approach that connects and engages with consumers on the emotional level, where they make decisions.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This article was originally published online online on 4 July 2018 by Financial Mail on BusinessLive.co.za. <strong><a href=\"https://www.businesslive.co.za/redzone/news-insights/2018-07-04-challenging-the-status-quo-in-financial-services/\">Click here</a></strong> to read the original version.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["content-marketing","financial-mail","financial-services","marketing","suzanne-stevens"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"challenging status quo financial services brightrock by samantha du chenne most recent&nbsp;financial mail&nbsp;adforum event held association with ornico sector came under spotlight typically competitive industry been affected constrained economy consumer base that doesn’t believe bigger always best alarming deficit [&hellip;] recent&nbsp; mail &nbsp;adforum trust consumers are willing give new market players chance instead blindly following traditional leaders suzanne stevens executive director marketing brightrock spoke adforum saying insurance brand today’s landscape many levels there belief brought global its knees; have who little trust brands whom legacy tradition mean very little mention crop fin tech start ups taking – making headway she said this environment gdp shrunk 22% business confidence down honeymoon phase country’s leadership now over president cyril ramaphosa tasked rebuilding what predicted economic slowdown there 12% drop purchase long term policies growing environment easy task stevens points out use one directional broadcast strategy bulk their adspend going television space extremely cluttered moreover media consumption fragmented today quickly discarding one must stick life ’s become clear strategy needed order differentiate behavioural&nbsp; neuroscience &nbsp; gone long way towards showing how make decisions reports decisions about providers made emotional level need provide tools they require facts figures equally crucial creating connection says companies differentiate perhaps winning hugely environment connect them level says stevens while still much value found methods innovations related content social platforms create opportunities key premise connections conversation engagement big take differentiation cluttered requires innovative approach connects engages where decisions article originally published online 4 july 2018 businesslivecoza click here read original version content staging news content marketing financial mail financial services suzanne stevens"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":5625,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":5523,"date":"21 May, 18","author":"BrightRock","heading":"BrightRock offering group risk cover","excerpt":"<p>Life assurer BrightRock is entering the employee benefits space by offering group risk cover to employers.

At their core, the insurance structures offered to employees today are the same as they were in the 1980s, based on a flat multiple of salary model, which in practice, leaves most scheme members substantially underinsured at younger ages when they face the largest financial exposure, relative to employees at older ages, who are nearing their retirement age.</div>\n</div>\n<p>“This inefficient structure has meant that, to remain competitive, insurers have cut the benefits offered to employees, creating uncertainty for scheme members and undermining their sense of financial security.

The new post-millennial equivalent is burgers and airtime.</p>\n<p>Discovery Business Insurance aims to be the truck driver’s friend. It still offers Vida lattes and Kauai smoothies. But to really get into this market it has brought in that health food colossus Wimpy as a partner, plus all four cellphone companies (including Telkom). Let’s hope they don’t use the airtime while they’re driving.</p>\n<p>Discovery is taking on some excellent businesses, such as Santam and Hollard, in this space — a far cry from previous competitors such as a badly run medical aid industry.</p>\n<p>It is extending many of the themes it has in place in personal lines insurance.</p>\n<p>Discovery Insure boss Anton Ossip says the business reward is based on the average Vitality Drive for Business score. Each truck is installed with a DQ-Track device, which gives full access to driving information. Then up to 30% of the cost of insuring the vehicle comes back in rewards, and if they’re lucky the drivers might share a bag of chips too.</p>\n<p>To be fair, Discovery’s intrusive approach has reduced road deaths, as 90% of accidents are due to human error. It is the joint responsibility of fleet management and drivers to solve this.</p>\n<p>Discovery would love to give the impression that it is the only innovator. But in fact BrightRock, a group of exiles from Discovery, is also in the game. It has just launched a product in the much less glamorous world of group risk (death and disability). As a pension fund trustee I know this is highly commoditised.</p>\n<p>But as BrightRock CEO Schalk Malan puts it, the structure is due for an overhaul. Typically it provides a death benefit of four times salary, which is far too little at a younger age to support a family in the event of death and, especially, disabled people for the rest of their lives.</p>\n<p>Malan says cover is based on the total value of future pay cheques. It will mean employees older than 55 need to top up their cover to get to previous levels, but BrightRock makes this available (up to double the group cover) at the same wholesale rate as the group cover itself and without medical underwriting. Of course over-55s make for a powerful lobbying group as they include most of senior management, who may not want to change. But companies and their pension funds must look at the greater good.</p>\n<p><strong>Individual client</strong></p>\n<p>It is also useful that when employees leave a company BrightRock lets them continue with their cover on the same terms as an individual client.</p>\n<p>Like Discovery, BrightRock is at the complex end of the insurance spectrum, but in an age of robo advice and other forms of instant gratification it has a niche among the more sophisticated life intermediaries. It has 4,300 advisers selling its products.</p>\n<p>Its largest shareholder, Sanlam, believes it appeals to a different market from the vanilla Sanlam-branded businesses.</p>\n<p>And it seems right: it wrote R1.1bn in annualised premium income with 64% year-on-year growth and it covers 1.3-million lives. It has already paid R549m in claims.</p>\n<p>One of its best innovations is that while most people have to go through two years of temporary disability before they receive a lump sum payout, BrightRock gives them the choice of a lump sum or an income on the day a disability has been diagnosed. And customers can enjoy a full salary equivalent, not just the standard 75% of pensionable salary.</p>\n<p>Malan promises that the cover per premium rand is substantially increased. For a premium that would buy R250m in traditional cover it offers R400m in needs-based cover, with the option to buy up to R712m worth with top-ups.</p>\n<p>It was the life industry’s turn to climb the wall of shame. The long-term insurance ombudsman has released its annual report. A passing grade would be when no more than 25% of an insurer’s cases were found wholly or partly in favour of clients. BrightRock got a distinction with just 9.1% of disputes going against it.</p>\n<p>The worst offenders were Old Mutual Alternative Risk on 57.2%, Vodacom Life and Smart Life both on 50%, Workers Life (47.6%) and Nestlife Assurance (43.8%). Perhaps these businesses are too small to run in-house complaint-resolution departments and simply outsource this function to the ombudsman’s office. Vodacom Life may be small, but the reputation of the entire Vodacom Group could be threatened if it keeps losing cases.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the larger insurers, Sanlam has the best batting average, losing 14.5% of cases, well below the 24.1% for Momentum, 25.4% of Old Mutual and 32.4% for Liberty. These statistics may be crude but they give a good indication of a company’s ability to resolve problems. No business with a poor record can claim to be client-centric.</p>\n<p>Deputy ombudsman Jennifer Preiss tells me the main source of complaints (47.7%) is for claims declined as the policy terms or conditions were not recognised or met. Next, with 30.2%, is poor communications, documents or information not supplied, and generally poor service. Claims rejected on the basis of nondisclosure account for barely 5% of the total but for a quarter of all disability-related disputes.</p>\n<p>One of the perennial complaints in the past — dissatisfaction with policy performance at maturity or surrender — has fallen to barely 5% of the total. This is partly because the life insurance industry is no longer the custodian of the nation’s savings, a position it has lost over the past 20 years to pension funds and collective investment schemes.

Their success in the market is evident in the company’s financial performance, with R1.1 billion in annualised premium income and 64% year on year growth – numbers that cement its reputation as the fastest-growing player in the intermediated individual risk insurance market.</p>\n<p>According to Schalk Malan, CEO of BrightRock, they are ready to further fuel their growth by driving the same kind of change in the group risk environment with a new group risk offering, following the same needs-matched principles they offer in their individual risk product.</p>\n<p><strong>A changing world of work</strong></p>\n<p>According to Malan, traditional group risk products have many of the same shortcomings BrightRock sought to address when they entered the individual life market. “They are standardised, commoditised and one-size-fits-all solutions that fail to meet employees’ and employers’ needs. At their core, the insurance structures offered to employees today are the same as they were in the 1980s, based on a flat multiple of salary model, which in practice, leaves most scheme members substantially underinsured at younger ages when they face the largest financial exposure, relative to employees at older ages, who are nearing their retirement age,” explains Malan.</p>\n<p>“This inefficient structure has meant that, to remain competitive, insurers have cut the benefits offered to employees, introduced limited pay-outs and barriers to claim, creating uncertainty for scheme members and undermining their sense of financial security. This has been happening in an increasingly competitive job economy where employers are struggling to attract and retain talent, and face growing pressure from employees to offer valuable benefits that better meet their individual needs.”</p>\n<p>“Change is needed – and we believe BrightRock’s needs-matched philosophy positions us to change the group risk market.”</p>\n<p><strong>Needs-matched product design, for a needs-driven world</strong></p>\n<p>According to Malan, BrightRock can offer more sustainable, efficient cover by following the same needs-matched principles that underpin their individual risk product.</p>\n<p>“In contrast to traditional group risk products, our group risk product calculates (and displays) each employee’s total value of future pay cheques. We then give every person in the company the same level of cover relative to the number of pay cheques they have left until retirement – this is not only a fairer split of the group’s cover, but also a far more efficient way to structure and price cover.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to this approach, group risk clients can get up to 40% more cover for the same premium for the scheme as a whole.</p>\n<p>“Our group risk cover meets employer and employee needs, and provides greater certainty and flexibility, now and in the future. It also better suits the demands of a changing workforce.”</p>\n<p>Employees also have access to BrightRock’s industry-first innovations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No reassessment of permanent disability claims: </strong>Instead of using subjective occupational criteria, BrightRock is the only provider in the market to pay on diagnosis for 67 conditions by using a market-first, objective list of clinical claims definitions. There is an occupational underpin for additional claims certainty. And, unlike other products in the market, there is never any in-claim reassessment of permanent expense needs claims;</li>\n<li><strong>Unrivalled pay-out flexibility:</strong> BrightRock is the only provider to offer members, or their beneficiaries, the choice between (or even a combination of) lump-sum and recurring monthly pay-outs at claim stage, when they know exactly what their financial needs and circumstances are;</li>\n<li><strong>Access to more cover, free of underwriting: </strong>Employees can buy up to double their group risk cover free of medical underwriting, subject to maximum limits. This enables employees to benefit from the group’s insurability to close gaps in their insurance;</li>\n<li><strong>Portability between group and individual cover: </strong>BrightRock offers employees the ability to convert their group risk cover to an individual life policy on leaving the scheme. This offers members valuable portability of their benefits in a job market where people are likely to change employers several times throughout their lives.</li>\n<li><strong>BrightRock’s industry-leading cover for additional expenses</strong>: BrightRock’s clinical claims criteria were developed in partnership with international clinical and risk experts, ensuring claims criteria that are objective and transparent. A best-seller in the individual life market, BrightRock has now extended the same principles and features to ensure a compelling critical illness solution for group risk schemes. Through the Trauma IQ assessment, they also provide market-first cover for the additional costs employees may face after traumatic events and accidents, providing members with pay-outs for claims no other insurer in the market would pay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Delivering on their mission</strong></p>\n<p>Since entering the independent, intermediated risk insurance market six years ago, BrightRock has grown rapidly and is the fastest-growing player in its sector, a position it has maintained for the past number of years. To date, BrightRock has, through its individual life and life assistance business, achieved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over R1.1 billion in annualised premium income with 64% year on year growth</li>\n<li>&gt; R200 billion total cover in force</li>\n<li>&gt; 1.3 million lives covered on our BrightRock licence</li>\n<li>&gt; 4&nbsp;300 independent financial advisers nationwide</li>\n<li>R549 million paid in claims, with the largest claim paid to date of R29 million</li>\n<li>Highest cover amount in force of R183 million on a single life</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“It is our aspiration to grow BrightRock into a fully-fledged financial services player of scale, and we are excited to take further steps towards this goal by changing the employee benefits space with our group risk offering,” says Malan.</p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.brightrock.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BrightRock-Media-Release-May-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> for more information about BrightRock and its Group Risk offering.</p>\n<p><strong>About BrightRock </strong></p>\n<p>BrightRock was established in 2011 with the goal of offering highly differentiated life insurance products to better meet clients’ and financial advisers’ needs.

We ensure that this vision is embedded in the actions of each and every one of our employees by encouraging a collaborative and entrepreneurial spirit, which in turn continues to enable us to drive the business forward.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Always put your clients’ interests first or build products that really create value for your clients</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We put clients’ interests first by designing a product that tracks the changes in clients’ financial needs over time, so they pay only for the cover they actually need. It’s more cost-efficient and sustainable, because we strip out wasted cover to deliver premium savings. In doing so, we also create more value for our clients. But it’s not just the product that puts clients’ interests first – by communicating our cover in simple, plain language without intricate terminology and clauses, our clients are empowered to understand what they signed up for. This principle of client-centric design can be applied in any business.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Play on a differentiated playing field &gt;&gt;&gt; Stand out from the crowd, create your own niche</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>BrightRock operates in a competitive and well-established market, so we understood we couldn’t compete if we simply did things the way they’d always been done. We created our own playing field with new rules, where we differentiate what we do in every facet of our business. This is done on various levels – from our highly advanced product and systems architecture; to having the best claims definitions in the market; to offering a high touch; personal claims experience; personalised documentation; various initiatives offering support for independent financial advice; to our content-led consumer marketing strategy.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>There will be twists and turns, no new business perfectly follows the original business plan</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any successful entrepreneur will tell you that you will need to constantly adapt and make changes to your business plan to stay at the top of your game. This needs to be done without compromising on the reasons <em>why</em> you started your business. One of many examples of this in the BrightRock story is that we originally had envisaged a Johannesburg-based head office. These days, we have a large contingent of our staff based in Port Elizabeth – delivering cost efficiencies and service improvement to our servicing model, much to the benefit of our clients.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Never give up</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the beginning of any new venture, it is hard because many people doubt you. We were told we were nuts to leave successful careers to start something new and take on the big boys. That doubt can be crippling if you let it be. You’re constantly watching the cash flow and new business numbers and need to recruit and motivate people based on a promise of what the business will become. There will be many sleepless nights and dark-hours-of-the-morning butterflies-in-the-stomach, but just keep going – your perseverance will eventually pay off.</p>\n<p><em>* This article was first published by Entrepreneur Magazine on 3 May 2018.

This makes it even more important to make your money go far. Your clients’ most valuable asset is their ability to earn an income so they can secure they and their families’ future. Protecting that asset becomes even more essential during tough times.</strong></p>\n<p>For your clients with children, protecting their income becomes a bit more complex as childcare needs increase at a higher rate than most of their other needs. The cost of day care, school, university, books, extra murals, sporting equipment and medical aid for children – to name just a few things – increases at a rate much higher than inflation. That’s why it’s imperative that life insurance products keep up with those changing needs, allowing you to structure your client’s policy in a way that factors in that they might need the cover for their childcare needs to increase at a higher rate than the rest of the policy.</p>\n<p>No parent wants to think of suffering from an illness or injury that leaves them unable to work or earn an income – or worse, die. Getting appropriate cover – that can truly take care of all their children’s financial needs – will leave your clients with peace of mind. Your clients should take into account what their children’s financial needs are when they are alive and what those needs would be should the unthinkable happen, and the client passes away. The needs of clients and their beneficiaries are constantly changing, so you might want to check whether your clients’ policies are flexible enough to allow them and their beneficiaries to decide how they would like to be paid out at claim stage, when they have the full picture of what they’ll need.</p>\n<p>It’s also vital to ensure that your clients’ children are also covered on the policy – for the same medical conditions as their parents – should they become seriously ill or injured. There are strict laws surrounding the amount of cover parents can get for their children in South Africa – and for good reason. We want to avoid cases where clients benefit financially from their children’s illnesses, injuries or death. There are, however, insurance providers that will pay out up to a maximum of R10 000 (the maximum allowed by current legislation) should a client’s child pass away, going some way towards easing the financial burden in such a tragic situation.</p>\n<p>There are also some insurance providers that will also pay-out clients’ temporary expenses cover for a certain period should their child become seriously ill. This allows parents to take time off work so they can take care of their children without worrying about the impact on their finances.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>This article was first published by FA News on 22 March 2018.

There are major technological developments on the international front that offer our industry the opportunity to cement its global status and to match individual needs. Some of these innovations are already driving change in the local industry, while the arrival of others is imminent. Schalk Malan, CEO of BrightRock, looks at five of the major developments that are set to change the industry as we know it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. The rise of Blockchain</strong></p>\n<p>Financial service providers are starting to wrap their heads around the major opportunities Blockchain-technology has to offer the industry. Insurers are particularly optimistic about the prospect of Blockchain enabling a significant reduction in administrative costs, and a vast improvement in security. Huffington Post reports the removal of fraudulent claims and activities with its end to end auditability is critical to Blockchain’s advantages. Claims can be processed faster and smarter, especially when a customer is in distress. Blockchain will change the life insurance business into a smarter and flexible one ii.</p>\n<p>In July last year, the South African Financial Blockchain Consortium (SAFBC) was formed, which aims to set up a national blockchain iii. Prior to this in 2016, a group of South African banks successfully swapped an asset among themselves using a private ledger on the Ethereum network iv. We will see increasing engagement, collaboration, research and development in the industry to implement this technology into our systems and product offerings. According to Deloitte, insurers are likely to see the implementation of this technology in tandem with further advanced analytics, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) v.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Personalised/Precision medicine</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Reinsurance Group of America (RGA) vi, personalised medicine enables medical professionals to better understand the complex mechanisms underlying an individual patient’s health risks, disease or condition, and to better predict which treatments will be most effective. This is done through genomics – the study of patients’ genes. It is hoped to lead to improved therapies and interventions to prevent and treat disease in a more efficient and effective way, thereby leading to decreased deaths and illnesses.</p>\n<p>The availability of personalised medicine in South Africa is set to become more common following the recent launch of the African Genomics Centre vii. It is hoped that the launch of the centre will enable quicker diagnoses and more targeted treatment of conditions that contribute to our health system’s disease burden, bringing personalised medicine to the wider public.</p>\n<p>Expected to herald a “New Golden Age in Medicine”, personalised medicine is expected to have a significant impact on the life insurance industry, as its offerings may drastically change the way applications are underwritten and how claims are decided. From clients’ perspectives, life insurers are faced with the possibility of individuals mitigating their risk through genomics, by making preventative changes to their lifestyles and monitoring and/or concealing any existing conditions viii.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The continuing rise of Big Data</strong></p>\n<p>Big Data continues to enable the industry to become more responsive in an increasingly volatile risk environment. We have already seen how massive international clinical databases make it possible to access evidence-based clinical data on the average recovery durations for serious illnesses or injuries. In the long term insurance space, it has made it possible for us to develop products that are intuitive, flexible and customisable to match clients’ needs very precisely. But the data innovation company Hortonworks warns that insurance companies will have to continue to nurture new skills in the data science-field. To stay a step ahead, companies will have to compile careful blends of people, process and technology to make the most of the vast amount of information at their disposal ix. This approach will enable product providers to harness this data and integrate it into their product design, enabling a variety of pay-out options according to individual needs.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Multi-channel engagement</strong></p>\n<p>While it’s common knowledge that our customers are becoming increasingly digitally inclined, access to financial advice, products and policy documentation through multiple platforms continues to create new opportunities to improve our servicing in the market. There is a rise in the number of market players who are selling long-term products direct to consumers through already existing online platforms, but there is a demand and regulatory requirement for insurers to match this simplicity through mobile applications and online portals where existing clients are properly informed about their benefits due to a lack of face-to-face financial advice. There already are platforms where clients do not only have access to documentation, but also to financial advice through live-chat functionality.</p>\n<p>In the intermediary space, where there still is a continued demand for high advice with the sale of more complex critical illness and disability products, there is similar trend. Forward thinking players in the market are doing more to empower advisers through user applications and online portals with user-friendly interfaces that provide customised information and documentation for advisers and each individual client.</p>\n<p><strong>5. The internet of things (IoT)</strong></p>\n<p>IoT refers to a network of digitally connected physical devices that interface with the real world and communicate with each other and with server systems. Innovation Enterprise writes wearable technology like Fitbit and other health apps and wearables can transmit data to life insurers, enabling them to more accurately assess the risk of a policyholder and adjust their risk distribution and management strategies accordingly x. IoT is already making inroads in the short-term product offerings of some South African insurers, and is set to become more common throughout the industry as it becomes more affordable, accessible – and advanced.</p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Forward-thinking long-term cover providers are already harnessing some of these technologies to create products that are intuitive, flexible and customisable to match clients’ needs very precisely and offer good value for money. The only way the rest of the industry will be able to follow suit, will be by embracing these technological advances to reduce costs, and provide tailor-made solutions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This article was published by FA News on 23 February 2018.

They have increasing spending power, which in turn, increases their insurable risk – something the South African insurance industry has not yet fully tapped into.</p>\n<p>In a short 2017 survey KPMG conducted to gauge the traction of South African Millennials in the insurance industry<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[ii]</a>, and they found that 89.47% of their sample has life cover and about 50% have disability cover and funeral cover. Lower on the scale in terms of long term insurance, is dread disease cover, followed by credit card cover – which has the lowest penetration of 10.53%. Considering that 80% of their sample also has car insurance, it is very likely that KPMG’s sample is representative of a higher income group that has access to- and can afford life cover. With that said, the lower penetration of dread disease cover in this sample is indicative of the fact that not all their insurance needs are met.</p>\n<p><strong>Win the trust of Millennials</strong></p>\n<p>An important step towards signing up more Millennial policyholders, according to KPMG, is to meet their expectations by engaging with them on a breadth, scale and level of detail that will allow insurers to become more responsive to their needs.</p>\n<p>In order to resonate more strongly with the Millennial customer base, KPMG recommends that insurers base their marketing strategies on six pillars: personalisation; managing, meeting or exceeding customer expectations; minimising time and effort; integrity and engendering trust; positive resolution and empathy.</p>\n<p>Another mechanism to win the trust of Millennials is through User Generated Content (UGC), as Millennials – made cynical by the fall-out of the financial crisis – tend to trust people over brands. According to a report by Bazaarvoice<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\"><sup>[iii]</sup></a>, Millennials have a much higher propensity to sign up for products or services when they are exposed to UGC recommending it. In fact, 84% of the Millennials who participated in this study, indicated that UGC influences their buying decisions, versus 70% of the Baby Boomers the researchers consulted. A further breakdown of these statistics found that 29% of the Millennials in the study will not complete their insurance purchases without UGC.</p>\n<p>It is also interesting to note that more Millennials favour the opinions and recommendations of likeminded consumers (51%), rather than family and friends (49%). In other words, connecting with Millennials is about relatability and relationships.</p>\n<p><strong>The impact of significant life changes</strong></p>\n<p>Industry research has shown that consumers’ propensity to initiate an insurance purchase is far higher when they experience life-changing events, such as marriage or the birth of a child.</p>\n<p>A 2012 study in the Journal of Risk and Insurance found that new parents were 40% more likely to buy life insurance cover. It also showed an increase in self-initiated life insurance purchases when starting a new job. These significant life changes not only impact consumers’ finances, but also their health, lifestyle and sense of identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Building personal connections</strong></p>\n<p>Financial advisers have long understood the importance of building personal connections with their clients. However, product providers tend to limit their messaging to the functional and financial aspects of their products, and the interaction between provider and consumer tends towards the factual and rational.</p>\n<p>However, it is important to bear in mind that these are deeply personal moments that reshape the way we look at the world, and the way the world looks at us. The emerging field of behavioural economics has shown that people are far more driven by emotions and unconscious biases when making financial decisions than previously thought.</p>\n<p>That is why insurers and financial advisers need to embrace marketing mechanisms that focus on personal experiences and even enable consumers to share their experiences with others like them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>This article was first published in FA News on 1 February, 2018.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\">[i]</a> <em>How to sell insurance to Millennials – 7 tactics for the next ten years.</em> By Ryan Hanley for Agency Nation.

The event, the first-ever awards for professional rugby players by professional rugby players, was designed by the players themselves to precisely match their needs and wants when it comes to recognising excellence on the rugby field. Provider of needs-matched life insurance, BrightRock, and MyPlayers, the South African rugby players’ organisation, hosted the evening.</p>\n<p>The awards evening was attended by players, celebrities and fans from all over the country. TV presenter and actress, Boity Thulo, and former Springbok, Jean de Villiers, acted as event MCs, and celebrity beatboxer, Morgan Beatbox, local band, Rubber Duc, and singer, Yollandi Nortjie, performed during the event, which was also broadcast live on SuperSport. On stage to help hand over the awards were well-known celebrities including Sureshnie Rider, Sky Tshabalala, Bouwer Bosch, Stuart Taylor, Eloise Cupido and cast members from Getroud met Rugby.</p>\n<p>The evening took a surprise turn in the form of hidden talent displays by the players, where Puma Hugo Kloppers impressed with his singing and guitar skills, and Dillyn Leyds, Teboho Mohoje and Trevor Nyakane also wowed the audience with a dance number. There was even a “Dub Smash” number featuring some of South Africa’s best loved rugby players singing along to popular tunes.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t just the players, performers and presenters who got to shine at the awards. In a heart-warming gesture, the Springbok Player Group donated R50 000 out of the players’ collective income in support of Lifa Hlongwa, a talented young player who sustained serious damage to his spinal cord in August this year while playing for the Northwood Crusaders in a match against Amanzimtoti. The funds were donated to the Lifa Hlongwa #OneStepAtATime crowdfunding campaign, which was started by the Chris Burger Petro Jackson Players Fund.</p>\n<p>Elma Smit, marketing manager for MyPlayers, commented: “At MyPlayers we&#8217;re very passionate about creating more opportunities like these. For players to give back to causes close to their hearts, to get to know fans better and to celebrate the excellence of their peers. The organisation, owned collectively by South Africa&#8217;s professional rugby players, enables rugby players to do what they do best, while we take care of their collective needs and interests behind the scenes. We would like to congratulate Siya on this highest of honours, as far as we are concerned. Siya was also recently also selected by the directors of MyPlayers to serve on the board from 2018.”</p>\n<p>BrightRock executive director, Suzanne Stevens, echoed Smit’s congratulations and added that the evening tied in with BrightRock’s unique needs-matched insurance offering. “We’re excited to have partnered with MyPlayers and the players themselves, helping them craft a needs-matched awards event where they got to decide about every aspect – from the awards categories to the winners, to the format of the event – even the entertainment. This is very much aligned with BrightRock’s philosophy, which enables every client to precisely design their own life insurance solution that matches their specific individual needs, and in the process extract better value for money – in effect putting change back in our clients’ pockets. Now that’s the kind of change we love!”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;For media enquiries and opportunities, contact Lesego Malete at 011 463 2198 or lesego.malete@hkstrategies.co.za.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>_ Ends</p>\n<p><strong>The BrightRock Players Choice Awards Categories</strong></p>\n<p><em>All nominations were compiled by the MyPlayers Board, their Trustees and player representatives and the winners of each category (except the Fans’ Choice category) were selected by the players.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Category Winners &amp; Runners up</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defender of the year Winner: Malcolm Marx.<br />\nRunners up: Jean-Luc du Preez, Siya Kolisi, Philip Snyman</li>\n<li>Forward Player of the year Winner: Siya Kolisi.<br />\nRunners up: Chris Dry, Franco Mostert, Warren Whiteley</li>\n<li>Backline Player of the year Winner: Rosko Specman.<br />\nRunners up: Ross Cronje, Dillyn Leyds, Mathrin Simmers</li>\n<li>Best off the bench Winner: Steven Kitshoff.<br />\nRunners up: Faf de Klerk, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Akker van der Merwe</li>\n<li>The #LoveChange Award – for the most-improved player over the past year – a true change agent on his way up Winner: Makazole Mapimpi.<br />\nRunners up: Lionel Cronje, Sbu Nkosi, Jan Serfontein</li>\n<li>The Fans’ Choice Award – as voted by the fans Winner: Francois Venter<br />\nRunners up: Siya Kolisi, Seabelo Senatla, Curwin Bosch, Courtnall Skosan</li>\n<li>The Players’ Player of the Year – the flagship award of the evening for the player selected as the best player of the year, as chosen by his peers Winner: Siya KolisiRunners up: Makazole Mapimpi, Rosko Specman, Warren Whiteley</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The runners up in each category are listed in no particular order</em></p>\n<p><strong>About MyPlayers</strong></p>\n<p>MyPlayers is the official organisation of the professional rugby players in South Africa.

Even on that basis, and notwithstanding the fact that it took financial advisers a while to wrap their head around BrightRock&#8217; s way of doing things, it is the fastest-growing player in its sector.</p>\n<p>BrightRock now has more than 4,000 independent financial advisers selling its product and is adding a few hundred more on a monthly basis, says marketing director Suzanne Stephens, who describes 2017 as a &#8220;seminal&#8221; year for the business.</p>\n<p>The might of Sanlam&#8217;s agency force is sure to add impetus to BrightRock&#8217; s new business growth. Premiums have grown 62% year on year in 2017,with BrightRock now boasting R982m in&nbsp; annualised premium income. From a zero base in 2012, BrightRock now covers more than 1-million lives.</p>\n<p>The disruption is welcome.</p>\n<p>By designing its products in a fundamentally different way to traditional life insurers, a new entrant such as BrightRock shows up shortfalls in existing products, which are often opaque and do not perform in the way the customer is led to believe they will. Yet these are products off which the industry has pocketed billions of rand in premium income over years.</p>\n<p>There have undoubtedly been improvements, thanks largely to consumer protection regulations such as Treating Customers Fairly. Competition also spurs change. But products delivering very little value for money are still out there.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that existing life insurance products will &#8220;change with you as your life &#8211; changes&#8221; BrightRock&#8217; s unique selling point, if for no other reason than that it takes 25-million algorithms to<br />\nproduce a single client quote, says CEO Schalk Malan. This is because each policy document is unique to the client. Even if competitors wanted to copy BrightRock, they would find it exceptionally difficult to get their hands on its product technology , which has drawn international interest.</p>\n<p>Why so many algorithms?</p>\n<p>BrightRock&#8217; s life insurance product precisely tracks the changes in a person&#8217;s financial needs over time, so that policyholders pay only for the cover they actually need at any given point in time.</p>\n<p>Cover is specifically matched to meet a person&#8217;s household budget needs, childcare needs, healthcare needs, debt needs and so on, in a way that would, for example, account for salary adjustments<br />\nand major life changes.</p>\n<p>Malan reckons this precision enables individuals to buy 40% more cover on average with each premium rand. The value of premiums paid is never lost: policyholders can move paid up premiums between different needs and insurance events.</p>\n<p>The uniqueness of BrightRock&#8217; s product, while compelling, may prove a growth inhibitor in that it is not sold through direct channels.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it is more consumer friendly than most policies, which is rightly working in its favour.</p>\n<p><em>ziadyh@businesslive.co.za</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>This article was first published in Business Day, on 27 November 2017.</em></li>\n</ul>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":["business-day","hanna-ziady","news","schalk-malan"],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"upstart&#8217;s personalised policies lift brightrock sanlam&#8217;s recent acquisition 53% stake clear sign that &#8220;needs matched&#8221; life insurer shaken things long term insurance sector deal valued r721m brings powerful distribution force brightrock which relied independent financial&nbsp;advisers sell its product even basis notwithstanding [&hellip;] fact took financial advisers while wrap their head around brightrock&#8217; s way doing things fastest growing player now more than 4000 selling product adding few hundred monthly says marketing director suzanne stephens who describes 2017 &#8220;seminal&#8221; year business might agency sure add impetus new business growth premiums have grown 62% 2017with boasting r982m &nbsp; annualised premium income from zero base 2012 covers 1 million lives disruption welcome by designing products fundamentally different traditional insurers entrant such shows shortfalls existing products are often opaque perform customer led believe they will yet these industry pocketed billions rand income over years there undoubtedly been improvements thanks largely consumer protection regulations treating customers fairly competition also spurs change delivering very little value money still out there unlikely will &#8220;change with your &#8211; changes&#8221; unique point other reason takes 25 million algorithms produce single client quote ceo schalk malan this because each policy document client competitors wanted copy would find exceptionally difficult get hands technology drawn international interest why many algorithms precisely tracks changes person&#8217;s needs time policyholders pay only cover actually need any given point time specifically matched meet household budget needs childcare healthcare debt would example account salary adjustments major changes malan reckons precision enables individuals buy 40% average rand paid never lost: can move between events uniqueness product compelling may prove growth inhibitor sold through direct channels hand friendly most policies rightly working favour ziadyh@businesslivecoza article first published day 27 november 2017 content staging news business day hanna ziady schalk malan"},{"ACF":{"related_posts":null,"guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null}},"id":394,"date":"25 Oct, 17","author":"BrightRock","heading":"Estate Planning for New Parents","excerpt":"<p>You are planning to start a family, but how do you ensure that you cover your child’s financial needs should something happen to you and your spouse?

Leopold Malan, executive director of BrightRock, stresses the importance of having your health cover and long-term insurance cover in place when starting a family.</p>\n<p>Your parental concerns and plans will differ for parents with young children, to those with adult children. Furthermore, Klokow points out that those with handicapped or special needs children, or with children from a previous marriage will have additional considerations.</p>\n<p>The first thing you should do when considering estate planning is to contact a qualified financial adviser who can advise you on your financial situation, and the potential financial needs of your children upon your death.</p>\n<p><strong>What financial products should you have in place?</strong></p>\n<p>Klokow emphasises that a common concern with minor children is how to provide sufficient income for them. Another is how assets will be managed and preserved to provide the financial resources needed until they reach adulthood.</p>\n<p>Will Keevy, head of insurance at Insurance Busters, notes that the first thing parents should do is get a will with a testamentary trust attached to it.</p>\n<p>“A testamentary trust is basically if something happens to both parents, then instead of the money going to the guardian’s fund, which is run by the government, it goes into a trust which is managed appropriately for the child, until a specific age, be it 18 or 21. It’s better managed, you don’t want the government to manage the kid’s finances. Whatever is left behind (finances after parents’ death) will then be applied to bringing up the child. It’s also important if you are going to have a guardian, the guardian needs to understand what you have in place,” says Keevy.</p>\n<p>It is also important to have adequate risk cover in place. This can include things such as life cover and disability cover to other financial products. Keevy points out that you will need to insure your income so that it can be allocated to help with the education of that child and their other financial needs in the event of your death. Setting up a trust in your will does no good if there is nothing to invest in it when you die.</p>\n<p>Malan points out that it is also important to prepare for any loss of income you may encounter. You should have long-term insurance in place that is flexible enough for you to add cover as you start and add new additions to your family.</p>\n<p>“Also remember that an unexpected complication with your child – like a heart defect, for example – can have a significant burden on your finances. There are long-term insurance products that can provide cover for childcare in the event of a child’s critical illness, enabling you to be with and to support your child during critical periods like these,” reveals Malan.</p>\n<p>The next thing you should consider when you have a child is saving for their education. This is often something that parents prioritise first, but Keevy stresses that while saving for education is important, you need to take care of the risk first. “You will always make a plan to get a child educated if you don’t have the savings,” says Keevy.</p>\n<p><strong>What about any property left behind?</strong></p>\n<p>Any property that parents may own needs to be considered in estate planning. What you decide will largely depend on where the child will live in the event that both parents pass away. Keevy notes that it is unlikely that in this type of situation a child would remain in the family home.</p>\n<p>“I would rather sell the property and invest that money to help the guardians look after the child. You don’t want to dump your child on a guardian without any financial support, it’s also not right,” says Keevy.</p>\n<p><strong>Guardianship</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to minor children, it is important to decide who you want looking after them in the event that you or your spouse die. It is vital that you discuss your decision with the person you have in mind to ensure they are willing to take on the responsibility.</p>\n<p>“It is important to choose a guardian or set of guardians that are able to provide emotionally, financially and physically for your children, and who have agreed to be guardians for your children in the event of your untimely death. If you have your estate planning and life cover in place that makes provision for your children’s education and day-to-day living expenses (factoring in inflation, as well as the significant jump in expenses for tertiary education), you can have a lesser emphasis on the financial strength of your chosen guardian. Your choice of guardians should also be stipulated very clearly in your will,” highlights Malan.</p>\n<p>There are a number of things you need to keep in mind when choosing a guardian:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The guardian needs to know who they are.</li>\n<li>Explain the responsibilities that a guardian will have.</li>\n<li>Explain what precautions you have taken to care for your children in the event of your death.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“If anyone makes you the guardian of their child, ask if they have a plan in place. It’s all well and good being a guardian, I will bring up your kid as best I can, but you can’t put that financial burden on him/her. Very few people think of that,” notes Keevy.</p>\n<p>When choosing a guardian, also be cautious of the age of the people you are choosing. While you may want your parent to be the guardian of their grandchild, are they the most suitable candidate?</p>\n<p>“If your parents are younger, fair enough, but you have to take into consideration the environment they are going to grow up in &#8211; going and living with grandparents versus growing up with other kids,” says Keevy.</p>\n<p>With older guardians health might also be a factor that could impact the desired guardian’s ability to care for your child. However, it is possible to create a hierarchy when choosing guardians. Here you will have your first choice of guardians (for example your parents), but if they are unable or unwilling to care for your child, you have a second person appointed to the role.</p>\n<p>If a guardian hasn’t been appointed, Keevy explains that the State will get involved. “What will probably happen is they will go to the closest family. But do you want that decision to be made for you by somebody else?” notes Keevy.</p>\n<p>Klokow adds: “Every family is different with its own circumstances. It is essential to have an up-to-date will. Speak to a specialist estate planner to assist you in weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of different estate planning structures, taking into account all the relevant factors applicable to your situation. A rushed decision may have irreparable consequences for your loved ones.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>This article first appeared in Just Money on 8 June 2017.

It was hard to work out if these multiheaded hybrids of protection and savings were good value for money.</p>\n<p>But there is also product sophistication, when highly customised technology can add something new and desirable to the product range.</p>\n<p>BrightRock falls in the sophisticated rather than the complex bucket. This insurer was formed in 2011, at a time when there was a race to the bottom as plutocrats such as Douw Steyn turned life cover into a commodity.</p>\n<p>BrightRock was founded by a multidisciplinary team, some of whom wanted another challenge after the big company atmosphere at Discovery. No company in the world runs its policies in the same way as BrightRock. As CEO Schalk Malan puts it, it is a needs-matched approach.</p>\n<p>A traditional life policy combines all cover in a single capitalised lump sum, which might be fixed or grow at a set rate over time. The trouble is that some financial needs exist only for a few years, others last a lifetime. So why should you pay for cover you don’t actually need?</p>\n<p>You might have heard of BrightRock from its sponsorship of the Stormers as well as from some chat shows it sponsors on SuperSport and kykNET. But you won’t see it much on peak-time conventional advertising slots. I sometimes think Willem Roos of OUTsurance has bought all the slots there and sells them on to competitors when he is feeling generous.</p>\n<p>Anyway, BrightRock quite rightly doesn’t believe its product set is appropriate for direct sales. It is sold through 3 800 accredited financial advisers, who gathered R6100m in premium income in 2016.</p>\n<p>BrightRock’s key selling point is that it strips out wasted cover to deliver premium savings. And you never lose the value of your savings: when needs fall away you move your premium to buy more cover for a different need, say from death to disability. And if the client needs more cover, he can reserve future years and take it up when needed.</p>\n<p>A feature that impresses me is the ability to make a choice on how to take on disability or critical illness cover at claims stage. It is hard to know at the inception of a policy whether a guaranteed income or a lump sum is more important. Expected longevity and severity of the condition need to be taken into account.</p>\n<p>At BrightRock, the client does not have to choose upfront but can decide if income, a lump sum or a combination of both is the right approach.</p>\n<p>BrightRock provides a graphic with six kinds of needs ranging from household needs, which are likely to grow at least at the rate of inflation, to healthcare, which tends to grow ahead of inflation, as would unpredictable costs of illness or injury and death-related needs such as estate duty and bequests.</p>\n<p>In contrast, debt – such as bond and car payments and personal loans – should eventually come to an end, as should childcare costs. Each of these financial goals is provided for by a distinct tranche of the policy, each of which has its own termination date and is disclosed in the written updates.</p>\n<p>I was interested to see that SA is seen as the most innovative life insurance territory, accounting for 46% of the votes in a recent Munich Re survey. Australia scored a feeble 6%. But in spite of this there is an inefficient pricing structure here and the policies can’t adapt to clients’ changing needs. It is hard for clients to alter their cover in what BrightRock calls critical change moments.</p>\n<p>Marketing director Suzanne Stevens points to a real case in which BrightRock proved to be a better option than any of its competitors. A teacher just 38 years old took out a policy in May 2014 worth R5.5m for disability and dread disease. In September of that year she went into a coma from pneumococcal meningitis and died eight days later. Under the ruling that most life offices follow, if a client dies within 14 days of an “event”, such as a stroke, the policy pays nothing. The only exceptions are Discovery Life, though it would have given less disability cover for the same premium, and Liberty, which would have paid somewhat less than BrightRock for disability and paid nothing on dread disease. But life offices such as Old Mutual, Momentum and Sanlam would have paid absolutely nothing. Is that treating customers fairly?</p>\n<p>Karl Leinberger, the chief investment officer of Coronation, seems quite defensive on the topic of long-term investment. I am not sure why, as the Coronation Equity Fund in its 20-year existence has added 60% to the all share index return. Some people see talking long-term as a way to buy time in a poor year such as Coronation experienced in 2015. And quite a lot of mediocre fund managers do ask clients to wait for the long term even though they are doing badly.</p>\n<p>Leinberger has probably added as much value from the shares he hasn’t picked than from the shares he has. He showed a slide from the 2008 road show in which he explained why he did not own Murray &amp; Roberts, then seen as bulletproof because the infrastructure boom around the Fifa World Cup was in full swing. The share has since gone from R110 to R11. Leinberger says that in a time of lower returns it makes even more sense to invest with an active manager.</p>\n<p>Of course he would say that, but it seems fair enough to argue that skill becomes more valuable in challenging times. In fact, good managers often do more alpha (excess return) in weak markets than in bull markets. Just look at Allan Gray, which routinely adds almost all its alpha in bad markets.</p>\n<p>I am a strong believer in giving fund managers a balanced mandate instead of trying to juggle the whole range of different asset-class building blocks in a fund. Leinberger makes the point that a balanced manager can make asset allocation decisions in real time – no need to wait for approval at the next trustee meeting. The manager needs to understand the total portfolio, the rand hedge position across asset classes on a see-through basis, the total interest rate holdings and the total inflation hedge.</p>\n<p><em>* This article first appeared in Business Day on 10 February 2017.

This view is fundamentally flawed, a financial planning professional says.</strong></p>\n<p>Craig Torr, director at Cape Town-based financial planning practice Crue Invest, says that just because the stay-at-home partner does not earn an income does not mean the family would not suffer financial loss if that person were to die or become disabled.</p>\n<p>“According to our financial planning principles, we believe in preparing a joint financial plan for both spouses – irrespective of who works, who doesn’t, or how much each earns,” Torr says. “Regardless of income, qualification or career, the couple is running a joint household and is jointly responsible for the financial future of the family.”</p>\n<p>Torr takes as an example a family of four, where the wife is the sole breadwinner and, by mutual agreement, the husband is a stay-at-home father to the couple’s two small children. The natural, and correct, assumption is that the wife would require assurance in the event of her own death or disability, Torr says. If she were to die, she would need her life cover so that  her husband could  maintain the family’s standard of living , invest for the children’s education and fund his retirement. If she were to become disabled, she would need her disability cover to pay her a monthly income until she reaches retirement age. And if she were to suffer a debilitating illness, she’d probably also require lump-sum severe illness cover to provide capital to cover the additional expenses.</p>\n<p>“However, many couples fail to ask the question: what would happen to the working partner and children if something happened to the stay-at-home partner – in this case, the father?” Torr says.</p>\n<p>A  host of functions  would have  to be replaced, he says. The stay-at-home parent’s job description is likely to include performing household chores, grocery shopping, paying and managing  domestic workers, lifting children to and from school and extra-murals, liaising with schools and teachers, supervising homework, and preparing meals and school lunches.</p>\n<p>“The reality is that a full-time father might not earn an income, but he does work. His role is the most important job on Earth,” Torr says. If the husband were to die, questions the breadwinner wife would need to consider are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Would I have to hire an au pair or a child-minder to take care of the children in the afternoons?</li>\n<li> Would I need to hire a tutor to help my children with homework?</li>\n<li> What would happen during school holidays? Would the children go into  holiday care, or could I rely on other members of the family to look after them?</li>\n<li> Would I need to hire a domestic worker (or increase domestic help) to prepare meals ?</li>\n<li> Would I consider cutting back on my hours of work in order to spend more time with my children?.</li>\n<li> Would I consider having my parents (or in-laws) move in with me to assist with the children?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Torr says: “Our society, in general, undervalues the role of the stay-at-home-parent, and this is never more evident than  in the field of financial planning. In the words of GK Chesterton, ‘How can it be a small career to tell one’s own children about the universe? How can it be broad to be the same thing to everyone and narrow to be everything to someone? No, a [stay-at-home parent’s] function is laborious, but because it is gigantic, not because it is minute.’”</p>\n<p>The reality is that the loss of a stay-at-home parent is greater than anyone can  quantify, and you need to consider risk cover for that person too, Torr says.</p>\n<p><strong>Needs-matched cover for stay-at-home parents</strong></p>\n<p>Schalk Malan, the chief executive of life assurer BrightRock, says although his company is not the only provider to insure stay-at-home parents, its needs-matched approach to life and disability assurance makes it well suited to do so.</p>\n<p>“With BrightRock’s needs-matched product structure, disability and income protection cover for a stay-at-home parent can be uniquely tailored in terms of cover amounts, premium increases and pay-out structure to meet the family’s household, childcare, healthcare and debt needs. Unique features include the ability to choose between a lump sum and a recurring income at the point of claim, when the family better understands the stay-at-home parent’s prognosis and their financial needs. Families can also buy additional cover or change cover when their needs change, without medical underwriting.</p>\n<p>“BrightRock will calculate the stay-at-home parent’s ‘income’ at a maximum of half of the working spouse’s income, and maximum rand limits apply. Income-earning clients who choose to become stay-at-home parents, take time off work or take extended maternity leave will keep all their BrightRock cover in force at their existing cover amounts for up to 12 months. In both of these scenarios, clients will continue to have access to the additional features of our product offering, which enables them to change their cover as their needs change.</p>\n<p>“We believe it is worth protecting income for stay-at-home parents, given the role they play in families’ financial well-being,” Malan says.</p>\n<p><strong><em>This article first appeared on Saturday, 1 July 2017 in the Personal Finance section of Independent Newspapers (The Weekend Argus, Pretoria News Weekend, Saturday Star and the Independent on Saturday), as well as IOL.co.za. </em></strong><strong><em>Click <a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/personal-finance/dont-under-estimate-the-worth-of-the-non-breadwinner-10072195\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a></em></strong><strong><em> to read the original version.</em></strong></p>\n","categories":["content-staging","news"],"tags":[],"relatedPosts":["profile-schalk-malan-ceo-brightrock","interesting-claims-paid-out-for-group-risk-cover","income-protection-cannot-take-an-umbrella-approach","brightrocks-needs-matched-group-risk-product-in-action-certainty-when-members-claim"],"searchString":"don’t underestimate worth non breadwinner brightrock many people believe that only family breadwinner needs have life disability severe illness cover this view fundamentally flawed financial planning professional says craig torr director cape town based practice crue invest says just because stay home partner does earn income mean would suffer loss person were die become disabled according our principles preparing joint plan both spouses – irrespective who works doesn’t how much each earns torr regardless income qualification career couple running household jointly responsible future family takes example four where wife sole by mutual agreement husband father couple’s two small children natural correct assumption require assurance event her own death disability she die need life cover  her could  maintain family’s standard living invest children’s education fund his retirement disabled pay monthly until reaches retirement age debilitating illness she’d probably also lump sum provide capital additional expenses however couples fail ask question: what happen working children something happened case father  host functions  would   replaced he parent’s job description likely include performing chores grocery shopping paying managing  domestic workers lifting from school extra murals liaising with schools teachers supervising homework meals lunches reality full time might work role most important earth questions consider are:  would hire au pair child minder take care afternoons tutor help homework  what during holidays go into  holiday care rely other members look after them domestic worker ( increase help) prepare cutting back hours work order spend more time children having parents laws) move assist children says: our society general undervalues stay home parent never evident than   field planning words gk chesterton ‘how can career tell one’s about universe broad same thing everyone narrow everything someone [stay home parent’s] function laborious gigantic minute ’ parent greater anyone  quantify risk too needs matched schalk malan chief executive assurer brightrock although company provider insure parents its approach makes well suited with brightrock’s product structure protection uniquely tailored terms amounts premium increases pay out structure meet household childcare healthcare debt needs unique features ability choose between lump sum recurring point claim when better understands prognosis their families buy change change without medical underwriting brightrock will calculate ‘income’ maximum half spouse’s rand limits apply income earning clients extended maternity leave keep all force existing amounts 12 months these scenarios continue access offering which enables them change protecting given they play families’ well being malan article first appeared saturday 1 july 2017 personal finance section independent newspapers ( weekend argus pretoria news weekend saturday star saturday) iolcoza   click here read original version content staging"},{"ACF":{"frame":["life_event"],"type":["story"],"format":["text"],"style":"narrative","tone":["serious"],"audience":["25 - 34 All"],"geography":["All"],"goal":"engagement","pull_quote":"","guest_expert":{"image":null,"blurb":null,"name":null,"twitter_handle":null},"related_posts":[{"id":11775,"pull_quote":"","type":["story"],"format":["text"]}],"evergreen":false,"last_reviewed":"","download":false,"embed":"","price":"Free","rating":"1","apple_link":"","google_link":"","web_link":"","app_developer":""},"id":5477,"date":"15 Oct, 17","author":"BrightRock","heading":"South Africa’s Players’ Player of the Year and other rugby peers to be recognised at the inaugural BrightRock Players Choice Awards","excerpt":"<p>BrightRock and MyPlayers join forces to host &nbsp;first-ever awards by rugby players for rugby players Johannesburg.

October, 2017 – Provider of needs-matched life insurance, BrightRock and the MyPlayers, the South African rugby players’ organisation are proud to announce that they will be launching the first-ever BrightRock Players Choice Awards – an event by the players, for the players where professional South African rugby players will honour and acknowledge their peers.</p>\n<p>The awards – the first of their kind in South Africa – will be taking place on 12 December 2017 at the Sandton Convention Centre and will be hosted and attended by players from all over the country. It allows professional players from all fourteen unions to recognise their peers through a nomination and voting process, which will culminate in an entertaining evening where winners will be announced in seven award categories. The flagship award will be the coveted Players’ Player of the Year award.</p>\n<p>Through the Fans’ Choice category, the BrightRock Players Choice Awards will also allow fans to vote for their favourite players.</p>\n<p>According to Elma Smit, marketing manager for MyPlayers, the launch of the BrightRock Players Choice Awards is the realisation of a goal set by the organisation years ago: To host a fun event where players from all over the country, as well as fans, can celebrate the successes and triumphs of their peers and heroes.</p>\n<p>“MyPlayers is the official organisation representing all the professional rugby players in South Africa. The organisation is 100% owned by the players and our organisation provides players with wide ranging support, such as managing their rights all the way to assisting with their career development. The BrightRock Players Choice Awards is an extension of our organisation’s offering by providing our players with a new platform to acknowledge and celebrate each other’s achievements at the end of the rugby season.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited to have a dynamic company like BrightRock as partners and co-creators of these new awards, and would love to reach out to all of South Africa’s rugby family and enthusiasts – we want to make this circle bigger!” BrightRock executive director, Suzanne Stevens, believes their involvement with MyPlayers is a further extension of the needs-matched life insurer’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VgnrYSoWbSA?list=PLSjBl-wReCAGTXX-TI85sJpgos60Dsix5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Play the Bounce philosophy</a>, which positively embraces the ever-changing, unpredictable nature of life and of rugby.</p>\n<p>“The BrightRock Players Choice Awards will be a celebration of the mastery, attitude and skill in the midst of the unpredictability in rugby. It’s a fantastic opportunity for the players to acknowledge their peers, their wins, their stories, their triumphs at navigating this fast changing game.”</p>\n<p>Stevens says their involvement with the BrightRock Players Choice Awards was a clear next step following the successful BrightRock Play the Bounce Braai in aid of the Players’ Fund, held earlier this year, where more than R350&nbsp;000 was raised for the Chris Burger Petro Jackson Players’ Fund. The MyPlayers organisation was also involved in supporting the initiative, making a substantial donation of R50 000 on behalf of the professional rugby players.</p>\n<p>Stevens explains that the concept of change is central to BrightRock’s needs-matched insurance offering, which is uniquely able to change with clients as their needs change over their lifetime. “Rugby, like life, is a game where the unpredictable is always a play away and can challenge even the best skill and preparation.” This is a central message behind BrightRock’s associate sponsorship of the DHL Stormers and DHL Western Province teams, now in its second year.</p>\n<p>“We hope and trust that our involvement in the BrightRock Players Choice Awards will further enhance the positive difference MyPlayers makes in the lives of professional rugby players.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ceremony will be live-streamed on Facebook and broadcast on SuperSport.

And with these changes comes a need to protect yourself. To make sure your loved ones are taken care of, or to safeguard yourself against an unstable economy.</strong></p>\n<p>But choosing what seems like “one day”-insurance at this point isn’t easy – especially when big life changes often come with big expenses. <a href=\"http://www.ubs.com/content/dam/WealthManagementAmericas/documents/investor-watch-1Q2014-report.pdf\">A report by UBS</a> found millennials are averse to financial risks since their earning abilities were severely affected by the global economic downturn of 2008/9.</p>\n<p>So how do you decide what type of cover you need and, most importantly, how to stretch every rand? Schalk Malan, CEO of BrightRock, answers some important questions that could benefit you in the long run:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What kinds of long-term insurance should I have? </strong>The most important events you need to consider are disability (temporary or permanent), death and dread disease How you structure it depends on your needs. Ask yourself, ‘What do I need this cover for?’ For instance, part of your lump sum cover might cover your bond and part might provide an income for you or your dependants. But your needs change as you get older: You’ll pay your bond off at some point and your children will become self-sufficient (hopefully!). Make sure that your life cover is flexible enough to change with your responsibilities?</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>How much should I be spending</strong>? Pay what you can afford, but appreciate that you can’t afford to ignore this. As a millennial who is just starting out in life, the most important thing to protect is your ability to generate an income as it’s your biggest asset. And the biggest threat to your income-earning ability is suffering a disability. That’s why you will need income protection to protect you against this risk. If you can’t cover your income fully, start with 50% or 25% – just start somewhere. But as your needs change when you buy property or have kids, for example – consider what happens to your dependants, if you lose your ability to earn an income – it will be important to make sure your cover changes as your life changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>What type of products would suit my generation?</strong> A forward-thinking product for a forward-thinking generation. First and foremost, products that get the most bang for your buck – there are products available that utilise innovative technology to offer clients up to double their disability cover for the same premium, often with richer benefits Flexibility when you claim is an important feature to look out for. A good product will offer you the ability to change your choice of a guaranteed recurring pay-out to a capitalised lump-sum (or any combination of income and lump-sum) at the point when you claim. BrightRock, for example, also offers you the ability to convert your disability cover anytime you no longer need it to cover for a different benefit, such as life cover or dread disease cover.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>What type of products should I avoid at this age?</strong> It might be a good idea to steer clear of products that give you your premiums back after a certain amount of time, as you’re probably paying 30% more on your premiums for this feature. Rather buy something that’s cost-effective now and get the saving into your pocket, then invest that extra 30%. Products that come in cheap today, at the cost of very aggressive unaffordable and unsustainable future premiums are another red flag.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>How do I choose the right provider?</strong> Look out for innovative companies who make it easy to understand the products you’re buying. Those who stay with the times, understand that technology advances at a rapid pace, and so should insurance. BrightRock offers needs-matched cover that is priced efficiently for the long-term. This means you get to choose how you want your cover structured, depending on what life stage you’re in, saving you money on unnecessary extras and reducing your premium.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>This article was first published by True Love Magazine, on  5 October 2018.

BrightRock shared an update on its business performance on the back of an announcement released by Sanlam on SENS on Friday, in which it announced that all suspensive conditions to the transaction that will give Sanlam a 53% stake in the needs-matched life insurance provider have been fulfilled, including regulatory approval.</p>\n<p>According to BrightRock CEO, Schalk Malan, BrightRock has grown rapidly in the independent intermediated risk insurance market and is the fastest-growing player in its sector, a position it has maintained for the past number of years. From a zero base in April 2012, BrightRock has grown to cover a total of over 860 000 lives (as at 30 June 2017). Total annualised premium income was R867 million for the year ended 30 June, while total cover in force now exceeds R180 billion<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\"><sup>[i]</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Malan says BrightRock is proud of what’s been achieved: “BrightRock came to market just five years ago with a fundamentally different, client-centric product design that can adapt seamlessly to changes in clients’ lives. We believe this focus on precisely meeting clients’ needs has been the driving force behind our consistently strong growth.” According to Malan, this structure is more efficient as it strips out unnecessary waste and delivers savings to clients. On average, BrightRock policyholders are able to buy 40% more cover with BrightRock for every Rand. “The statistics show that, when it comes to cover for their permanent expense needs, BrightRock clients on average get double the disability cover when using our needs-matched structure.”</p>\n<p>Besides delivering substantial costs savings to clients, Malan says BrightRock’s client-centric approach has allowed it to increase certainty for clients at claim stage: “We have focused our attention on removing unnecessary barriers to claim and ensuring that, through needs-matched product features, the pay-out at claim stage meets clients’ needs.” BrightRock has paid an average of almost R1 million in claims every day over the past financial year, with total claims paid since inception exceeding R470 million.</p>\n<p>According to Malan, BrightRock’s exponential growth trajectory is one of the key reasons for its new partnership with Sanlam, which will provide significant capital investment enabling BrightRock to deliver on its future plans. “We see it as a growth partnership and one that will provide an even stronger platform for BrightRock’s future growth and expansion. BrightRock’s aspirations include other product lines and markets, and our new partner is supportive of our objective of becoming a financial services provider of scale.”</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Sanlam and BrightRock will continue to function as independent businesses, retaining their own brands, life insurance licences and management teams. The transaction with Sanlam was implemented with effect from 1 September 2017 at a total transaction price of R721 million.</p>\n<p><strong>About BrightRock </strong></p>\n<p>BrightRock was established in 2011 with the goal of offering highly differentiated life insurance products to better meet clients’ and financial advisers’ needs.

This view is fundamentally flawed, a financial planning professional says.</strong></p>\n<p>Craig Torr, director at Cape Town-based financial planning practice Crue Invest, says that just because the stay-at-home partner does not earn an income does not mean the family would not suffer financial loss if that person were to die or become disabled.</p>\n<p>“According to our financial planning principles, we believe in preparing a joint financial plan for both spouses – irrespective of who works, who doesn’t, or how much each earns,” Torr says. “Regardless of income, qualification or career, the couple is running a joint household and is jointly responsible for the financial future of the family.”</p>\n<p>Torr takes as an example a family of four, where the wife is the sole breadwinner and, by mutual agreement, the husband is a stay-at-home father to the couple’s two small children. The natural, and correct, assumption is that the wife would require assurance in the event of her own death or disability, Torr says. If she were to die, she would need her life cover so that  her husband could  maintain the family’s standard of living , invest for the children’s education and fund his retirement. If she were to become disabled, she would need her disability cover to pay her a monthly income until she reaches retirement age. And if she were to suffer a debilitating illness, she’d probably also require lump-sum severe illness cover to provide capital to cover the additional expenses.</p>\n<p>“However, many couples fail to ask the question: what would happen to the working partner and children if something happened to the stay-at-home partner – in this case, the father?” Torr says.</p>\n<p>A  host of functions  would have  to be replaced, he says. The stay-at-home parent’s job description is likely to include performing household chores, grocery shopping, paying and managing  domestic workers, lifting children to and from school and extra-murals, liaising with schools and teachers, supervising homework, and preparing meals and school lunches.</p>\n<p>“The reality is that a full-time father might not earn an income, but he does work. His role is the most important job on Earth,” Torr says. If the husband were to die, questions the breadwinner wife would need to consider are:</p>\n<p>• Would I have to hire an au pair or a child-minder to take care of the children in the afternoons?</p>\n<p>• Would I need to hire a tutor to help my children with homework?</p>\n<p>• What would happen during school holidays? Would the children go into  holiday care, or could I rely on other members of the family to look after them?</p>\n<p>• Would I need to hire a domestic worker (or increase domestic help) to prepare meals ?</p>\n<p>• Would I consider cutting back on my hours of work in order to spend more time with my children?.</p>\n<p>• Would I consider having my parents (or in-laws) move in with me to assist with the children?</p>\n<p>Torr says: “Our society, in general, undervalues the role of the stay-at-home-parent, and this is never more evident than  in the field of financial planning. In the words of GK Chesterton, ‘How can it be a small career to tell one’s own children about the universe? How can it be broad to be the same thing to everyone and narrow to be everything to someone? No, a [stay-at-home parent’s] function is laborious, but because it is gigantic, not because it is minute.’”</p>\n<p>The reality is that the loss of a stay-at-home parent is greater than anyone can  quantify, and you need to consider risk cover for that person too, Torr says.</p>\n<p><b>Needs-matched cover for stay-at-home parents</b></p>\n<p>Schalk Malan, the chief executive of life assurer BrightRock, says although his company is not the only provider to insure stay-at-home parents, its needs-matched approach to life and disability assurance makes it well suited to do so.</p>\n<p>“With BrightRock’s needs-matched product structure, disability and income protection cover for a stay-at-home parent can be uniquely tailored in terms of cover amounts, premium increases and pay-out structure to meet the family’s household, childcare, healthcare and debt needs. Unique features include the ability to choose between a lump sum and a recurring income at the point of claim, when the family better understands the stay-at-home parent’s prognosis and their financial needs. Families can also buy additional cover or change cover when their needs change, without medical underwriting.</p>\n<p>“BrightRock will calculate the stay-at-home parent’s ‘income’ at a maximum of half of the working spouse’s income, and maximum rand limits apply. Income-earning clients who choose to become stay-at-home parents, take time off work or take extended maternity leave will keep all their BrightRock cover in force at their existing cover amounts for up to 12 months. In both of these scenarios, clients will continue to have access to the additional features of our product offering, which enables them to change their cover as their needs change.</p>\n<p>“We believe it is worth protecting income for stay-at-home parents, given the role they play in families’ financial well-being,” Malan says.</p>\n<p><strong><em>This article first appeared on Saturday, 1 July

The “My Training Day with the Springboks” on Wednesday, 21 June will see 50 u15 Vuka rugby players from all corners of Gauteng hone their game under guidance of SA Rugby Legends such as Stefan Terblanche, Pieter Muller and former Bok Coach, Ian McIntosh</p>\n<p>The training day will be hosted at Fourways High School, with six current Springboks on the field to give the young players a real feel for what the top of the game looks like. It will include a 45-minute non-contact training session, as well as TAG games and a 10-minute BokSmart presentation to educate young players on the importance of injury prevention, encouraging them to play smarter and safer rugby.</p>\n<p>This is the second year that provider of needs-matched life insurance, BrightRock, has supported the Players’ Fund. Suzanne Stevens, executive director, says that BrightRock’s involvement with the Players’ Fund is an extension of the company’s Play the Bounce philosophy, which embraces the ever-changing, unpredictable nature of life and of rugby.</p>\n<p>“On and off the field, the ball sometimes bounces in unexpected ways. The Players’ Fund and its recipients are proof that, with the right support, even the most challenging and unexpected changes can be handled in a positive, life-affirming way,” said Stevens.</p>\n<p>Launched in 2012, BrightRock has rapidly grown into one of the fastest-growing players in the intermediate individual life market in South Africa. According to Stevens, the concept of change is central to the BrightRock’s needs-matched insurance offering, which is uniquely able to change with clients as their needs change over their lifetime. Stevens sees this same ability to embrace and adapt to change in the activities of the Players’ Fund.</p>\n<p>According to Stefan Terblanche, CEO of the South African Rugby Legends Association, “It is indeed an honour and great privilege for our VUKA boys to have the opportunity to meet some of the Boks and former greats of rugby. As ex-players we love giving back to the game of rugby that we love. By getting involved in initiatives like these we do so two-fold, both by coaching these future Boks and also by supporting the Chris Burger Petro Jackson Fund. We know that many players suffer serious injuries while playing rugby and it is indeed a humbling experience to see the support they receive from The Players fund and how rugby can still bring a big smile to their faces.”</p>\n<p>“We are really excited and thankful to both BrightRock &amp; SARLA for this great opportunity in assisting us to raise much needed funds for rugby’s fallen heroes. We have always made it our mission to align with organisations and events that share the same ethos as the Player’s Fund and this is certainly the case with both the “The Play the Bounce Braai” and “My Training Day with Springboks. It’s an amazing once in the lifetime opportunity for the young Vuka rugby players to not only meet some of their favorite Springbok players but gain invaluable training and coaching. We are certain that both events will be a massive success”, adds Morné du Plessis, Founder and Chairman of the Chris Burger Petro Jackson Players’ Fund.</p>\n<p>The cost for the Bok Braai is R5 000 and includes two tickets to the evening event, and will also cover the cost of one of the young players to attend the training and development day.

But clients have different needs, some long-, and others short- or medium-term. BrightRock’s cover is designed to track each of a clients’ needs exactly as they change over time. This strips out unnecessary waste, making cover more cost efficient, relevant and sustainable. BrightRock policyholders are able to afford an average of 40% more cover for the same premium rand, from day one.</li>\n<li>Clients are able to change their cover when their needs change, thanks to industry-first features such as the cover conversion facility. Clients can easily access more cover when they need it. The cover conversion facility allows clients to use premiums for cover they don’t need anymore, to buy cover for other needs – free of medical underwriting. BrightRock’s needs-matched cover is also the only cover that allows policyholders to change their choice of a lump-sum pay-out to a regular monthly pay-out when they claim for an illness or injury with a financial impact that’s permanent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information, visit www.brightrock.co.za</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/EEMCS-05-2016-0070#</p>\n","categories":["content-staging","press-releases"],"tags":["announcement","brightrock","sanlam","shareholding"],"relatedPosts":["budgeting-for-the-future-how-life-insurance-policies-and-savings-plans-work-hand-in-hand","group-benefits-and-disability-claims-addressing-changes","brightrocks-2021-payout-equal-to-all-claims-paid-in-its-first-7-years-in-business","needs-matched-life-insurer-brightrock-announces-growth-in-2021-despite-a-challenging-time-for-the-life-insurance-industry"],"searchString":"sanlam set acquire majority stake needs matched life provider brightrock media release 25 january 2017 cape town – sens announcement released earlier today listed financial services group announced that 53% insurance brightrock subject regulatory approval according personal finance (spf) deputy ceo hennie de villiers all due diligence processes [&hellip;] have been finalised completion transaction dependent when final approvals are granted price depends date completion expected exceed r707 million (assuming approved completed first half this year) says acquisition line with sanlam’s strategy seek profitable sustainable growth opportunities testimony commitment invest south africa under agreement will continue function independent businesses retaining their own brands licences management teams believe established strong credible presence african market presents valuable proposition people’s needs villiers particular company’s innovative offering supports client focused philosophy our belief value advice by qualified accredited intermediaries offering together matrix which introduced significant innovations early 2016 puts us excellent position meet client needs further grow share ceo schalk malan says: brightrock proud welcome new shareholder business grown strongly since coming five years ago r148bn cover force over r611m api sanlam found true partner exceptional credentials supportive aspirations create highly differentiated autonomous scale ’re also pleased lombard group founding investors backed from inception remain shareholders going forward while products currently sold solely through brokers product range future available advisers broker distribution take alongside its offering inform interested parties progress regarding transaction &#8211;
