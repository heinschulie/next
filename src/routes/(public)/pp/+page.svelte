We will do our best to protect your information, but we can’t guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us online. You do so at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any damages you may suffer.</p>

			<p><strong>We receive information about your use of our site</strong></p>
			<p>We may use technology to gather information about your use of the website, including details of your operating system, browser version, domain name, and IP address. Your IP address is a string of numbers that tells us which server you are using but does not identify you.

			<p><strong>Take care when following links to our site</strong></p>
			<p>Where other parties have links to the BrightRock website, these websites’ administrators or owners may be able to collect your information when you click on these links.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Processed lawfully, fairly and transparently. This includes providing data subjects with appropriate information when collecting their information, in the form of privacy or data collection notices. BrightRock must also have a legal basis (for example, the data subject’s consent) to process personal information;</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Processed only for the purposes for which it was collected;</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Accurate and kept up to date;</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Will not be kept for longer than necessary;</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Processed in accordance with integrity and confidentiality principles. This includes physical and organisational measures to ensure that personal information, in both physical and electronic form, is subject to an appropriate level of security when stored, used and communicated by BrightRock. The purpose of these security measures is to protect the data against access and acquisition by unauthorised persons and accidental loss, destruction or damage;</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Processed in line with the rights of data subjects, where applicable.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>You have the right to know whether BrightRock holds personal information about you, and to access that information. Any request for information must be handled in line with the provisions of this privacy policy and BrightRock’s PAIA manual;</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>You may request the correction or deletion of inaccurate, irrelevant, excessive, out of date, incomplete, misleading, or unlawfully-obtained personal information;</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>You may object to BrightRock’s use of their personal information and request the deletion of such personal information (BrightRock will delete this information in line with our record-keeping requirements);</p>
